I really don't have much to say about this. It's just really fucking good. The flavors all come together really well and the crushed red pepper adds a nice spice that gives the whole thing the perfect bit of heat. I think the only thing I want to do different next time, other than maybe obtaining oyster sauce, is cracking the spaghetti in half to make it easier to apportion. [Picture of how mine came out](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/676978543640444928/767184472075403304/P_20201017_203444_1.jpg)\\n\\n2) [Turkey Taco Skillet](https://www.budgetbytes.com/turkey-taco-skillet/)\\n\\nI made this with ground beef instead of ground turkey and did not include the scallions/green onions. I don't really know the difference between the taco option and the quesadilla option, I think I did something in between. This is the one I just made so I haven't yet reheated the leftovers and eaten more than one portion. Regardless, who kept quesadillas/soft tacos from me all my life? idk if it's just this one or if they're generally amazing, but holy crap, it's really good, highly recommend it. Might edit in a picture if I can get a clean quesadilla out of the leftovers (didn't flip right the first time since it was my first time ever trying it)\\n\\n3) [Skillet Cheeseburger Pasta](https://www.budgetbytes.com/skillet-cheeseburger-pasta/)\\n\\nLike mac and cheese with some burger in it and a kickass sauce. Note that when Budget Bytes refers to ounces of cheese, they're referring to weight, not fluid. I figured that out from... somewhere, I don't remember. The pictures on the site don't do it justice for how cheesy it is, but it *is* supposed to be that cheesy and it's really good. The recipe mentions how the hot dog relish really gives it that burger taste and I very much agree. I doubt I'll use it for anything else, but I made two batches of this recipe and I'm very satisfied with my purchase.\\n\\n**A Tier**:\\n\\n4) [Sweet Chili Chicken Stir Fry Bowls](https://www.budgetbytes.com/sweet-chili-chicken-stir-fry-bowls/)\\n\\nUsed light coconut milk instead of regular, as suggested in the standalone savory coconut rice recipe, used the teriyaki sauce recipe rather than sweet chili sauce since I had all the ingredients for it already, and used a percentage of a larger can of pineapple chunks rather than an 8oz can of pineapple tidbits because stores near me did not have the latter. The star of this show was the coconut rice tbh. I don't usually like coconut because of its texture, but the coconut flavor along with the jasmine rice and the garlic all came together to make some really good-tasting rice. Especially since I used a rice cooker so I didn't need much water besides from the can of coconut milk. tbh this recipe doesn't really do the rice justice because the teriyaki mixture overpowers the subtle flavor of the rice. Maybe the sweet chili blends in better idk. Regardless, every component of this recipe tastes good. Only thing I'd change is that the recipe should call for an amount of broccoli that you can divide in four to make the same four portions that the chicken makes. Considering that frozen broccoli is sold in 12oz packages, not 16oz, I say just buy two packages and make them both at once and split in four for 6oz/portion rather than 5.3oz with none left for the fourth portion. [Picture of how mine came out](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/676978543640444928/765037168984064010/P_20201011_222347.jpg)\\n\\n5) [One Pot Teriyaki Chicken and Rice](https://www.budgetbytes.com/one-pot-teriyaki-chicken-and-rice/)\\n\\nThis tasted very similar to the above since I'd replaced the sweet chili in the above with teriyaki anyway. I think I liked the above recipe slightly more because I prefer the broccoli in that recipe over the mixed peppers I bought for this one's frozen stir fry vegetables. Also the coconut rice. It's mostly a matter of which process you prefer I suppose and then customize your preferred process to suit your palette \\n\\n6) [Simple Homemade Chili](https://www.budgetbytes.com/basic-chili/)\\n\\nI like this one chili recipe unlike the other one because it tells you how to customize it. Also because it tastes good. The customization options I used were using two pounds of beef rather than including beans, using Guinness beer instead of water (side note, not a big beer person, but I drank the leftover beer and I prefer Blue Moon and Miller Genuine Draft), and adding a teaspoon of smoked paprika, a cup of frozen corn kernels, some shredded cheese, scallions, and crushed tortilla chips. I really liked the chili a lot, but ngl by the sixth serving I was ready for something else. As a single man living alone, I'd definitely prefer if this recipe made four servings rather than six.\\n\\n7) [Poor Man's Burrito Bowls](https://www.budgetbytes.com/poor-mans-burrito-bowls/)\\n\\nI should probably make this again now that I've made more things, this is only the second thing I made, but I was really surprised by how much I liked it considering I don't generally like beans. The Turkey Taco Skillet also has black beans in it though and I like that too, so I might just only like black beans idk. Some recommendations for making this: Use a mild salsa, not medium. I used medium tostitos salsa and it was a little too strong for me. Also, slice your jalapeno as thin as you can and don't refrigerate it. It's very easy to have the jalapeno flavor be too strong. Other than that, go ham on it, it's a surprisingly good recipe.\\n\\n8) [No-Knead Focaccia Rolls](https://www.budgetbytes.com/focaccia-rolls/)\\n\\nThis would be ranked higher if the recipe were better made. They taste very good. Some tips: the rolls are never going to look like they do in the pictures, idk what filter they used on their camera or how their oven was miscalibrated or whatever. I used an oven thermometer to make sure my oven uses the right temperature and in waiting for it to get as golden on top as in the pictures, the bottom burned and the rolls were hard. They still tasted good after reheating them in the microwave on a damp paper towel since that softened them, but I recommend making them how I did the second time, only waiting a couple minutes longer than the 25 minutes the website says. They won't really look right, but they taste amazing, especially dipped in soup or olive oil. Some recommendations from the comments: If you want whole wheat, use one cup out of four rather than the usual two. Be super liberal with the flour. Use pinch and tuck rather than just rolling into balls. Use parchment paper rather than aluminum foil with cooking spray.\\n\\n**B Tier**:\\n\\n9) [Skillet Pineapple BBQ Chicken](https://www.budgetbytes.com/skillet-pineapple-bbq-chicken/)\\n\\nI used a nonstick skillet and a shitty bbq sauce (Open Pitt) and couldn't get it right. It still tasted pretty good because chicken, but if you're gonna make this, I recommend using a thicker bbq sauce and a stainless steel skillet or other type that's meant for making pan sauces, not nonstick. The pictures make it look super appetizing, but idk. I'll try it again when I buy a nonstick pan I suppose, it *is* chicken after all.\\n\\n10) [Weeknight Pasta Sauce with Spaghetti](https://www.budgetbytes.com/the-best-weeknight-pasta-sauce/) (using title from meal plan)\\n\\nNot sure what the author loves about the sauce so much. This to me was very standard spaghetti in sauce with a very small amount of ground beef that really didn't do much to bring it up a notch or anything. Not bad in the slightest, but nothing special.\\n\\n**C Tier**:\\n\\n11) [Curried Red Lentil and Pumpkin Soup](https://www.budgetbytes.com/curried-red-lentil-and-pumpkin-soup/)\\n\\nYou have no idea the hell I went through to get pumpkin puree for this recipe. No store near me had it for some reason. Anyway, this was a fairly decent soup, nice flavor, nothing special, good to dip those rolls in. C Tier because fuck pumpkin puree and how hard it was to find.\\n\\n12) [One Pot Chili Pasta](https://www.budgetbytes.com/snap-challenge-one-pot-chili-pasta/)\\n\\nThis one was ok, but I don't like beans and it makes 9 servings so by the time I finished it, I was pretty sick of beans. If I were to make it again, I'd swap out the beans for more ground beef. Would probably taste good then tbh. I like the corn in this recipe.\\n\\n13) [Easy Rosemary Garlic White Bean Soup](https://www.budgetbytes.com/easy-rosemary-garlic-white-bean-soup/)\\n\\nLots of beans, not really a fan, but I put in a lot of pepper which was great and of course it was good soup for dipping those rolls into. \\n\\n14) [Easy Cauliflower and Chickpea Masala](https://www.budgetbytes.com/easy-cauliflower-and-chickpea-masala/) \\n\\nI feel bad putting this last because I actually really liked the cauliflower and masala part, but there's a reason another name for chickpeas is garbanzo beans. They have the texture of beans. Not a fan.\\n\\n**Didn't Try**:\\n\\n[Slow Cooker White Chicken Chili](https://www.budgetbytes.com/slow-cooker-white-chicken-chili/)\\n\\nThis is the second to last recipe in the meal plan and at this point I am all beaned out and I just don't have it in me to make another 6 servings of a bean dish I know I won't like so I'm not bothering\\n\\n**Conclusion**:\\n\\nAll in all I had a pretty good time making and eating this food over the course of a month and a half or so. I really wish I liked beans because Budget Bytes uses them a lot and they're like, cheap and nutritious or something, but I've now tried beans in multiple dishes and I think I can say with certainty that I do not. I *would* recommend checking out this meal plan if you're like me and don't want to have to choose what to make every day. Some tips on using it: Do use the grocery list at the starting to know if you should buy something in bulk or just a small amount. Do look at the actual web page for each recipe so you can find tips and substitutions and comments rather than just the recipe. Do look at this post and the couple of tips I've scattered throughout.

The citrus ones were better over ice on a hot day, the floral flavors were better hot on a chilly morning. And the best part is this flavor tricks my brain into thinking I\\'m having a snack, which keeps me out of the fridge while I work from home. Granted, I don\\'t promote skipping meals as a form of eating healthy, but a hot cup of cinnamon tea with a bit of honey makes for a nice \"dessert\".  \\n\\n\\n I started with a sugar cube in my cup, but now I drink every glass with no added sugar or cream.

       "  \"Sometimes the pancake/omelette is a one-pan meal, other times I do make side dishes to make the meal more filling and nutritious. If you don't like the texture or want more variety, most of these would also work as scrambled egg!\\n\\nI have a small breakfast on my diet, but enjoy breakfast food, especially bacon, so having a breakfast dinner means I can get the breakfast flavours in a big meal. I like to make a classic style omelette filled with bacon, mushroom and cheese. Sautee the mushrooms in a separate pan and grill the bacon. Mix two or three eggs in a pan with melted butter. Add your filling before folding over. Use low fat mature cheese for maximum flavour for minimal calories. To make it more nutritious you can serve with grilled tomatoes or beans (as in British Heinz baked beans!). If you want to bulk it out cheaply and you're not as worried about calories as I, then serve with toast or hash browns.\\n\\nAnother British classic is toad-in-the-hole which is sausages baked in a Yorkshire pudding which is essentially crepe mixture. You can use vegetarian sausages which tend to be lower calorie than most meaty sausages. for recipes see: https://www.bbc.co.uk/food/search?q=toad+in+the+hole\\n\\nYou can spice toad-in-the-hole up by using flavoured sausages, add in some sliced chilis, onion and peppers. Or just make it herby with some sage & onion stuffing mixture.\\n\\nFrom my Wagamama cookbook is okonomiyaki. Fry a couple of slices of chopped bacon with finely sliced cabbage in a little oil. Make pancake batter, per person: 2 large eggs, 150ml milk, 50g plain flour, 1 tablespoon vegetable oil, whisked together. Once the cabbage is softened, add some extra oil, wait for it to heat up and then add the pancake mixture. While it's still soft, sprinkle over sliced spring onion (scallion) or reserve these to serve, I prefer to cook them slightly. Flip to make sure it cooks on both sides. You could also add prawns or use left over meat such as shredded chicken. I added some soy sauce and Worcestershire sauce to the pancake batter. The recipe says 50g of cabbage per person but you can bulk it out with more if you want.\\n\\nAnother version I like which is a bit of a mish-mash of cuisines is to use chorizo. You don't need a lot as it's full of flavour, so a £2 chorizo will make up to 8 portions of food. Slice it fine and add to a dry pan on a low heat. Let the fat render off and turn the heat to medium to fry red onion and sweet peppers. Maybe add a little more oil and seasoning. Then add your eggs/pancake mixture.\\n\\nFrom Spain is the Spanish omelette. Simply eggs, onion and potato if you follow a traditional recipe. You can add bell pepper or mushroom and extra seasoning if you want to make it a one-pan meal with some extra vitamins. Or serve with a stuffed pepper/mushroom. Sometimes I use sweet potato instead of white!\\n\\nThere's also frittata which is like a crustless quiche packed with veggies! This can be made in a pan or baked in the oven. I bake them in silicone cupcake cases for lunches or a picnic. In a bowl mix together egg and some cheese. I like to use goat's cheese and a bit of grated cheddar. You can add all sorts of grated or finely chopped veg: beetroot, spinach, onion, mushroom, courgette. And also season with complimentary herbs, parsley is nice with beetroot. Bake at about 180-200c for about 15 minutes. I usually throw these in while I'm cooking dinner one night and then they'll keep in the fridge a few days. If you prefer them warm you can then just nuke them in the microwave.\",\n",

I'll still buy my usual dairy products, I'll still eat cheese and eggs (which I don't consume much anyway) but I really wanna cut down on meat the most if there are affordable options that offer the exact same daily nutrients that chicken or beef offers, for example.

Im starting to get seasonings for some foods, like putting sriracha or black pepper or red peppers in stuff too. \\n\\nI’ve kinda got social anxiety! I have two roommates who are nice but they hang out a lot in the living room. I’m nervous about cooking in front of them, and eating in front of them. It’s just been a lifelong thing of mine, and I think eventually I’ll feel comfortable cooking in front of them.\\n\\nSo what im trying to ask for is if you guys have any healthy, easy meals to make that are kinda quick to make? I would really appreciate any insight you have. I don’t have a lot of people I feel comfortable asking so i really appreciate any ideas. I don’t like soups and I’m afraid of boiling things. Honestly I’m afraid of fire in general, but I can manage a frying pan okay haha. I really do not fuck with ovens. The reason is kinda pathetic, it’s because I have no depth perception so I tend to not understand where exactly things are in the world. I have burned myself a few times because I don’t know where precisely the hot object or liquid is haha! \\n\\nAnyways sorry for the novel, and thank you in advance for any ideas you have!\\n\\nEDIT: thank you so much for all these lovely replies!!! So many helpful ideas and I’m excited to put some diversity in my grocery cart haha!',\n",

I like to put about 2 sauces, meat (chicken breast/thighs, deli meat, fried fish, beef) and my favourite toppings are lettuce, tomatoes, cucumber, avocado and banana peppers.

Some of it will work, some of it won’t. Eat what grows.\\n\\n**Why I Made This Thread**\\n\\nYesterday, /u/MikeGrowsGreens posted a thread, [If you can, grow your own lettuce and microgreens](https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/j4lncx/if_you_can_grow_your_own_lettuce_and_microgreens/), in which he explained that it’s just not that hard to grow your own food.\\n\\nSeveral comments were critical, and I posted a few times in defense of the notion that gardening does not have to be as complicated as folks make it out to be. After I slept on it, I found I had a lot more to say. I believe it merits its own post, so here we are. Hope you agree.\\n\\nNothing in my life has helped me to eat cheap and healthy more than gardening has. I’m in the best shape of my life, and gardening is why. I’ve written this because I hope others will benefit. I wish I had known all of this years ago.\\n\\n**My Background**\\n\\nI was raised in a college town by parents who were born and raised in the city. We did not garden.\\n\\n*Their* parents had all been raised around gardening. Each of them had grown up poor, and they gardened to survive. They grew corn so they could eat corn and not starve.\\n\\nAs adults in the post-WWII era, they moved to the city, the men got pretty good jobs, and they took pride in the fact that they could afford to pay for other people to grow their food. As such, my parents were not exposed to gardening.\\n\\nIn my town, only the quirky gardened. It was a niche hobby. No one *needed* to garden. What’s the matter with just going to the grocery store? I couldn’t understand it.\\n\\nFurthermore, it looked like *so much work*, and such an *expensive* hobby. Buying a tiller. Preparing the beds just so. Building trellises. Tying plants up just so. Fertilizing in just the right way with expensive fertilizers. Vigilant searches for pests. Expensive pesticides. Who had the time and money for that?\\n\\nAbout a decade ago, I moved to the country with my wife and our kids, back to where she was born and raised. Over time, I’ve befriended many gardeners, hunters, foragers. It’s not as weird here.\\n\\n**The Gift Covid Gave Me**\\n\\nLike you, I experienced a pandemic this year. Early on, my priority was to increase self-sufficiency. It provided me a sense of control over the situation, I suppose. I was concerned that supply chains could break down, and I wanted to ensure that if worse came to worse, my family and my neighbors would be able to eat. So I decided to dip my toes into gardening.\\n\\nOn that last trip to the stores, the one where I had to go to three places before I found a package of toilet paper, I stocked up on medicines, bought a backup water filtration system (I backpack, so I already had some, but water’s important), and I bought ten to fifteen seed packets.\\n\\nAnd then I didn’t do anything with them. Looking back, I think I was just too intimidated, because I had internalized the belief that gardening is hard. Hell, I’ve watched my neighbor agonize over his garden for years. He’ll talk for as long as you care to listen about all of the problems that come with gardening. The labor. The expense. The pests. The diseases. The failures.\\n\\nPlus, I was kind of stressed about the whole pandemic thing. \\n\\nEventually, one of my sons was experiencing cabin fever and just looking for a good excuse to be outside and away from the rest of our quarantining family, and he asked if I minded if he got some of those seeds going. He spent about an hour on the task, having never done it before. He started spinach, kale, mustard, broccoli, and a variety of herbs.\\n\\nHe watered them occasionally until he headed back to his place in the city. As we learned more about the virus and how folks were going to be responding to it around here, he decided he was just as safe in his own place, and frankly it can be kind of frustrating to live with your parents as a young adult. So the seedlings became my responsibility. I didn’t really do much. I watered a few times.\\n\\nA couple weeks later, I could tell these little plants were running out of room in their seed pods, so I transplanted them into the spot my wife had used for gardening years back and paid them very little mind. But a few weeks later, I wandered over to them and found that I had greens to harvest. I was gardening.\\n\\n**How to Get Started**\\n\\nAround that time, I had the good fortune to stumble across two YouTube videos that I still point people to when they express interest in getting started: [Basil, How To Grow More Than You Can Eat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byoEBdVoVpM) and [5 Fast Growing Veggies You Can Harvest in Under 1 Month](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEt_120VEAM). In the latter video, Kevin talks about the importance of getting a win, and I could not agree more. \\n\\nI used to believe in the notion of a green thumb. And that I didn’t have one.\\n\\nI love the outdoors. My favorite vacation spots are wilderness areas. One of my life-long goals is to visit each U.S. scenic national park. So, naturally, I like the idea of having houseplants.\\n\\nBut I’m terrible at keeping houseplants alive. At this point, I mostly have pothos, because they like to be ignored. We’re a good fit.\\n\\nNow that I have some gardening experience, I’ve come to realize that I’m not good with houseplants because it doesn’t gel with my overall philosophy, which is to grow plants in alignment with nature. Houseplants tend to be varieties that grow naturally in humid tropical environments. I live in the midwestern U.S., and I like to keep my windows open, even in the winter.\\n\\nAs I’ve learned more over the last several months, I’ve observed that many expert houseplant growers don’t much care for gardening outdoors. My guess is that for the person who likes to learn exactly the right pH for a particular plant, precisely the right nutrients at just the right time to optimize houseplant growth, gardening outdoors is extremely frustrating. Natural forces are hard to battle.\\n\\nBut for those like me who find the processes of nature fascinating, gardening outdoors is a delight. Even when you ‘lose’ plants to bugs or disease or whatever. Delightfully fascinating.\\n\\n**Natural Gardening**\\n\\nOnce I experienced a bit of success, I was hooked. I watched every gardening video I could find. \\n\\nI had the good fortune to come across [this video about Masanobu Fukuoka](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2goMfMEf6TY), and I knew straight away this was for me. \\n\\nHere is an excerpt from his book, [*The One-Straw Revolution*](https://www.amazon.com/One-Straw-Revolution-Introduction-Natural-Classics/dp/1590173139):\\n\\n> The usual way to go about developing a method is to ask \"How about trying this?\" or \"How about trying that?\" bringing in a variety of techniques one upon the other. This is modern agriculture and it only results in making the farmer busier.\\n\\n> My way was opposite. I was aiming at a pleasant, natural way of farming which results in making the work easier instead of harder. \"How about not doing this? How about not doing that?\" - that was my way of thinking. I ultimately reached the conclusion that there was no need to plow, no need to apply fertilizer, no need to make compost, no need to use insecticide. When you get right down to it, there are few agricultural practices that are really necessary.\\n\\nIt occurred to me that this is just how I think about how I do my job. I’m an educator, and I’ve been told over and over again that I should be doing *this* or *that*, and when I point out that my students are successful without those things, I’m told that I’m lucky. I’m fifteen years in at this point. That’s a lot of luck.\\n\\nNo, just as I conceptualize education, the philosophy of natural gardening is to be mostly an observer. A gentle facilitator of natural processes. \\n\\nFukuoka was roundly criticized for his farming practices. The book is worth a read. He goes into his thoughts as to why his practices were not adopted by other farmers, despite the fact that his yields were comparable with far less labor and expense.\\n\\n> And so one may ask why this truth has not spread. I think that one of the reasons is that the world has become so specialized that it has become impossible for people to grasp anything in its entirety. For example, an expert in insect damage prevention from the Kochi Prefectural Testing Center came to inquire why there were so few rice leaf-hoppers in my fields even though I had not used insecticide. Upon investigating the habitat, the balance between insects and their natural enemies, the rate of spider propagation and so on, the leaf-hoppers were found to be just as scarce in my fields as in the Center’s fields, which are sprayed countless times with a variety of deadly chemicals.\\n\\n> The professor was also surprised to find that while the harmful insects were few, their natural predators were far more numerous in my fields than in the sprayed fields. Then it dawned on him that the fields were being maintained in this state by means of a natural balance established among the various insect communities. He acknowledged that if my method were generally adopted, the problem of crop devastation by leaf-hoppers could be solved. He then got into his car and returned to Kochi.\\n\\n> But if you ask whether or not the testing center’s soil fertility or crop specialists have come here, the answer is no, they have not. And if you were to suggest at a conference or gathering that this method, or rather non-method, be tried on a wide scale, it is my guess that the prefecture or research station would reply, “Sorry, it’s too early for that. We must first carry out research from every possible angle before giving final approval.” It would take years for a conclusion to come down.\\n\\n> This sort of thing goes on all the time. Specialists and technicians from all over Japan have come to this farm. Seeing the fields from the standpoint of his own specialty, every one of these researchers has found them at least satisfactory, if not remarkable. But in the five or six years since the professor from the research station came to visit here, there have been few changes in Kochi Prefecture.\\n\\nI took Fukuoka’s ideas to heart. I bought more seeds. I found a few plants at a farmer’s market, brought them home, and popped them in the ground. Then I watched.\\n\\n**What to Buy**\\n\\nIf I were to start from scratch today, here is what I would buy:\\n\\n* [seed pods](https://www.amazon.com/Seedling-Starter-Trays-720-Cells/dp/B00BRQ3QWK)\\n* soil - I like [this kind](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01508YKY8)\\n* seeds - I recommend [MIgardener](https://migardener.com/shop/) (inexpensive, fewer options) and [Baker Creek](https://www.rareseeds.com/) (more expensive, more options)\\n* a trowel\\n\\nFor real, that’s it. And truth be told, the seed pods and soil are optional. I just find them convenient and worth the expense.\\n\\n**What You Need to Know**\\n\\nOne super useful piece of information is your growing zone. I don’t know exactly how you’d go about that outside the States, but I bet it’s not that tricky. For me, I used the [USDA Plant Hardiness Zone Map](https://planthardiness.ars.usda.gov/PHZMWeb/). Knowing your zone will help you to choose plants that are likely to work in your environment.\\n\\nIt’s also good to know your location’s average first and last frost dates. All I did was google it for my zip code.\\n\\nThis information matters, because different plants thrive in different environments. I’m just about a week away from my average first frost date, so I won’t be starting tomatoes right now. I won’t be starting squash. Frost kills these.\\n\\nBut frost doesn’t kill everything. In fact, a lot of plants like frost. You can still plant right now. \\n\\nEverything you need to know is on YouTube. My favorites: [James Prigioni](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9V_-gqJsZNOy4v_HqbRz3w), [Charles Downing](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCB1J6siDdmhwah7q0O2WJBg), [Gardener Scott](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWsI0LmiDyezbnN2JCL4P9w), and [Liz Zorab](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCe0Ha5QljsCV5UqIkobBrcQ).\\n\\nI also highly recommend the book [The Four-Season Harvest](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1890132276), by Eliot Coleman. He argues that gardeners are mistaken when they conceptualize the year as growing season vs. not growing season. It can always be growing season.\\n\\n**Won’t My Plants Die if I’m Not an Expert?**\\n\\nYep. Some of them will. My suggestion is to accept this up front. Plan for it. \\n\\nAgain, I liken it to my teaching philosophy. If I allow students to make their own choices, won’t they make mistakes? Yep, they will. I account for that in my overall planning. The benefits outweigh the downsides, and it’s not close.\\n\\nIn my garden, I account for inevitable loss by planting a lot, and often. I don’t spend a lot of energy on the precise right date to put in new plants. Instead, I start seeds and see what happens. A week or two later, I start new seeds. The ones that didn’t come up last time? Maybe I start another round of those.\\n\\nI advocate this not because it is perfect. No, I advocate this because it is a solution to decision paralysis. If you’re like me, it’s hard to start without knowing exactly what to do. It’s overwhelming, and you just don’t start.\\n\\nThe most important bit is *to start*. You’ll gain expertise over time.\\n\\nEarly in the summer, I joined several gardening groups in my state. Most of the posts went like this: \\n\\n* Here is a picture of a bug on my plant. What do I do?\\n\\n* First comment: That’s an *a* bug. Kill it with *b*.\\n\\n* Second comment: No, that’s a *c* bug. Kill it with *d*.\\n\\nWell, following Fukuoka’s advice, I just let nature take its course. I planted squash, so I got squash bugs. I planted brassicas, so I got cabbage moths. I planted tomatoes, so I got hornworms.\\n\\nI left them alone and just watched to see what happened.\\n\\nSome of the plants died. But some didn’t. In fact, some grew back even stronger after the bugs had run their course.\\n\\nAt some point I decided to try adding some flowers to encourage predatory insects and birds to visit my garden to help out with the bugs, with the overall goal being to create, as closely as possible, a full, thriving ecosystem.\\n\\nTurns out hummingbirds like zinnias. I’ll plant them again next year for sure.\\n\\n**Why Do So Many Expert Gardeners Disagree With This Philosophy?**\\n\\nThat’s an interesting question to me. I suspect it’s mostly confirmation bias, and it’s why I included my backstory back up at the top of this post. I think it’s actually been to my benefit that I wasn’t raised by gardeners, because I didn’t have anything to unlearn.\\n\\nWithout edging too far into geopolitical territory, I think it’s fair to say that anytime anyone is doing anything, someone is going to try to make a buck off of it.\\n\\nSo, yes, an entire industry has developed around gardening. Buy this to increase yield. Buy that to prevent pests.\\n\\nI decided this year to do none of it. Again, following Fukuoka, I constantly asked, ‘what if I don’t do that?’ \\n\\nThere are a couple things I will do differently next year. One, I will probably build a trellis for my tomatoes. I did eat a lot of tomatoes this year, with the plants just sprawling out on the ground. But they were pretty susceptible to disease, and a number of them rotted because they were on the ground. Two, I’ll probably trellis at least some of my cucumbers as well. They did fantastic on the ground - I ate a cucumber a day for about two months - but they took up a lot of space. \\n\\nBut I still do not intend to fight pests or disease in any way other than trying to build that complete ecosystem.\\n\\nMy best guess as to why long-term gardeners look at my comments and think of me as naive and ignorant is the same reason I get that feedback from fellow educators. They’ve been doing it the hard way for so long, it’s damn near impossible for them to admit to themselves that they’ve been working themselves to the bone for no reason.\\n\\nYou’ve seen this where you work, right? The person who’s been doing the same job the same way for 20 years, and even though you can see that instead of spending six hours, they could do it differently in five minutes, they won’t hear you. You don’t know. You haven’t been there.\\n\\nWell, this is one of those situations.\\n\\nWhen my neighbor sees aphids, he digs in his books to find the ways to kill aphids. He hates them. When he sees squash bugs, he unleashes an attack on squash bugs. After he applies his treatment, they go away. He has won.\\n\\nBut here’s the thing. Mine went away too. At least *try* not doing anything.\\n\\n**Final Thoughts**\\n\\nI hope this post is useful to you. Gardening has changed my life. I have spent my entire life overweight and out of shape, and my best guess is that it’s because I’ve been in a micronutrient deficit my whole life, causing me to feel hungry even though I’d eaten plenty of calories. My body wanted nutrients.\\n\\nI eat fresh vegetables every day now. And while, no, they’re not free, they are cheap. Cheap and healthy. Win win.\\n\\nedit: formatting',\n",

       "  'Hello friends!  A year ago I posted one of my favorite make-it-a-meal methods, which is basically an bastardized version of dolsot bibimbap.  Today I have another bastardized meal for you, variations on shakshuka (could also be compared to eggs in purgatory).  To me, some of the most useful skills in eating cheap & healthy are **confidence and flexibility** \\\\- recognize the most important elements of a dish, then use what you have to make a limited pantry work, or just to add some variety.  This method, rather than strict recipe, reflects that.\\n\\n1. **Sauté some onions and garlic.**  (Type of onion doesn\\'t matter.  Prep doesn\\'t really matter either - I usually chop my onions, but sometimes I\\'ve used sliced and that\\'s fine as well. Ditto the sautéing material - use butter or olive oil or canola oil, whatever, it\\'s gonna be fine) **Optional additions:** hard vegetables such as peppers, carrots, or cabbage. (add at the same time as the onions)\\n2. **Add some spices.**  **Options to consider:** paprika, cumin, red pepper flakes, oregano, turmeric, curry powder, za\\'atar, harissa, gochujang, sambal oelek.  Obviously don\\'t add all of those together, but you get the idea.  The flavor is flexible, go with what you like & have on hand.  If you\\'re very hesitant about proportions & combinations, Smitten Kitchen has a good shakshuka recipe that you can look up as a standard baseline.\\n3. **Add some tomatoes.**  They can be canned or fresh, diced or smashed, I\\'ve ever seen some people say they just use plain tomato sauce (this one\\'s texture seems iffy to me but whatever floats your boat).  I use \"regular\" tomatoes but have heard of it done with cherry tomatoes, Roma tomatoes, tomatillos..... you get the idea.  Simmer over medium heat until their juices start to thicken into a saucy consistency.  **Optional additions:** cooked carb-y grains like chickpeas, lentils, rice... AND/OR leafy vegetables like kale, swiss chard, spinach.  Whatever you\\'re adding, you will probably want to add it in after the tomatoes have simmered a little bit so that they don\\'t get overcooked, but not at the very very end because they need a little time to warm up and/or wilt.\\n4. **Add some eggs.** Crack them on top of the whole thing.  Cover and cook for \\\\~4 minutes, until the whites are cooked through but the yolks are still runny.\\n5. **Add some toppings/serve-alongs.  Options to consider:** parsley, basil, cilantro, cheese (parmesan, cotija, feta...), avocado, sour cream, yogurt, toast, flatbread, tortilla chips.  Again, obviously don\\'t use all of these - try to keep in mind the flavor profile that you\\'ve already made with your spices & choice of tomatoes, and pick a couple additions that will enhance that.\\n\\nSo for example, today I used (1) some sliced red onions and minced garlic sautéed in veg oil (2) with paprika, cumin, & red pepper flakes and (3) a can of diced tomatoes and (4) 4 eggs with (5) buttered toast.  It was a very basic version of it, but tasty and filling.  \\n\\nAnother example - I have made it with (1) diced yellow onion, diced jalapeno pepper, & minced garlic sautéed in veg oil (2) with paprika, cumin, & za\\'atar and (3) canned crushed tomatoes, canned chickpeas, and fresh chopped kale and (4) 2 eggs with (5) yogurt and more za\\'atar. This is heartier & feels like a different meal thanks to a few changes.\\n\\nThis can be served for breakfast, lunch, or dinner.  It is ready to eat in less than half an hour.  I hope that the ideas here are helpful. Happy cooking! :-)',\n",

The other 70% of the time it either cooks too fast and I get large curds like Denny's-style scrambled eggs, or it cooks too slow and I get a pile of mush that I can't roll into shape, like Gordon Ramsey-style scrambled eggs. Does anyone have any tips for how to avoid these heat control errors? \\n\\nFor reference, here's my typical method:\\n1. Beat eggs into a fine, consistent liquid, with the whites fully broken down so my fork can come out of the bowl without having any egg globs hanging from it. \\n2. Add herbs and pepper. \\n3. Heat pan at medium-high heat (closer to the high side to get it started, like maybe at 75-80% heat). Melt butter onto heated pan. \\n4. Wait for butter to begin bubbling (about 10 seconds). Turn heat down to about 60-65%. \\n5. Pour on eggs and immediately begin shuffling the pan and stirring the eggs with a fork to prevent build-up of curds. Do this continuously until the eggs form a coherent uniform structure that I can begin rolling with a spatula. The eggs should be under cooked enough so that the excess uncooked egg on top rolls down the pan when I tip it forward. \\n6. With pan tipped forward, roll eggs down the incline of the pan as if I'm rolling up a carpet. Once the eggs are rolled to the bottom of the inclined pan, fold any excess egg over the top. \\n7.

       "  \"I tried to bake my trusty chocolate chip cookie recipe today in Western Europe and they turned out flatter than frisbees. \\n\\nThis recipe has served me well in Canada many times over and I follow it to a T using metric measurements. However, when trying to bake it again in Europe it was a disaster. Scroll to the bottom for the recipe ingredients and directions. here is what I did, followed by what I'm thinking of adjusting.\\n\\nIf anyone has experience transposing american cookie recipes to european ingredients  I would be greatful. I saw a post from a year ago about european butter but found the comments inconclusive. conversely, if someone has a good european chocolate chip cookie recipe I would be grateful as I have found nothing.\\n\\nWhat I did\\n\\n* measured in g precisely\\n* chilled the dough for 19 hours in the fridge before forming balls and baking\\n* formed the dough balls taller than they are wide, and 33g precisely in weight\\n\\nProposed troubleshooting ideas\\n\\n* I hear flour is unbleached in europe which can affect the outcome, additionally the protein content has an influence: Apparently using t65 flour as opposed to european all purpose worked for someone in France\\n* I hear the moisture content of european butter is different: I could use slightly less butter according to Stella Park's comment on her recipe (would adopt her whole recipe in that case to preserve ratios)\\n* increase the oven temperature and decrease cook time\\n* Add vodka to compensate for added moisture from butter (but how much?)\\n\\nRecipe\\n\\n* ½ cup granulated sugar(100 g)\\n* ¾ cup brown sugar(165 g), packed\\n* 1 teaspoon salt\\n* ½ cup unsalted butter(115 g), melted\\n* 1 egg\\n* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract\\n* 1 ¼ cups all-purpose flour(155 g)\\n* ½ teaspoon baking soda\\n* 4 oz milk or semi-sweet chocolate chunks(110 g)\\n* 4 oz dark chocolate chunk(110 g), or your preference  \\nPreparation\\n\\n1. In a large bowl, whisk together the sugars, salt, and butter until a paste forms with no lumps.\\n2. Whisk in the egg and vanilla, beating until light ribbons fall off the whisk and remain for a short while before falling back into the mixture.\\n3. Sift in the flour and baking soda, then fold the mixture with a spatula (Be careful not to overmix, which would cause the gluten in the flour to toughen resulting in cakier cookies).\\n4. Fold in the chocolate chunks, then chill the dough for at least 30 minutes. For a more intense toffee-like flavor and deeper color, chill the dough overnight. The longer the dough rests, the more complex its flavor will be.\\n5. Preheat oven to 350°F (180°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.\\n6. Scoop the dough with an ice-cream scoop onto a parchment paper-lined baking sheet, leaving at least 4 inches (10 cm) of space between cookies and 2 inches (5 cm) of space from the edges of the pan so that the cookies can spread evenly.\\n7. Bake for 12-15 minutes, or until the edges have started to barely brown.\\n8. Cool completely before serving.\",\n",
