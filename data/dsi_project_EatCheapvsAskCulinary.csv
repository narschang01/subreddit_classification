"Savory oatmeal recipes, what's your favorite?",1,jd0i1w,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/jd0i1w/savory_oatmeal_recipes_whats_your_favorite/,4,1602988492.0,"Edit: formatting 

I wanted to share this because when I talk to people about savory oatmeal, they are usually surprised or look at me like I'm a weirdo. Please tell me I'm not the only one who loves savory oatmeal.


My favorite recipe is spicy, with some sautéed veggies, a fried egg and some soy sauce.


My favorite combo so far:

- Mix cayenne pepper, black pepper, garlic powder, celery salt and coriander into dry oatmeal, add boiling water

- While that is cooking, sautée some leeks, green onion, celery and a few cherry tomatoes

- Crack an egg on top of those sautéed veggies

- Once cooked, add to oatmeal and pour over a tiny bit of soy sauce

Recently though, I’ve been making homemade hummus and adding a dollop of that to my salads, along with a teaspoon of olive oil and red wine vinegar. It’s amazing. The hummus adds a wonderful creamy texture and keeps the vinegar from being too overpowering.

If you can make your own hummus, you have a huge advantage. Chickpeas are cheap as dirt. And by making your own, you can control what goes into it, and limit the amount of salt/fat. 

Adding hummus to salads totally changed my life. Maybe this is a well-known thing and I’m just late to the party, but I figured I’d share for anyone wanting a healthier alternative to creamy dressings, like me.",eatcheapandhealthy

In an effort to just start drinking more water, I've migrated into a fascination of drinking 2-4 cups of tea a day (the second two are decaf). It's so easy and fast to make, and there are SO MANY flavors for a very affordable cost. I started with [this variety pack](https://www.amazon.com/Stash-Tea-Bags-Sampler-Assortment/dp/B07B3WC49R/ref=sxts_sxwds-bia-wc-p13n1_0?cv_ct_cx=stash+tea+sampler+box&dchild=1&keywords=stash+tea+sampler+box&pd_rd_i=B07B3WC49R&pd_rd_r=bb0a5fb1-e760-4346-845a-3d79ceef7c93&pd_rd_w=ZhEyo&pd_rd_wg=Vj4kD&pf_rd_p=aa27be45-7294-48a8-8c11-546cebd55a37&pf_rd_r=QRHF3KAFA9SP73X25SZ5&psc=1&qid=1602890334&sr=1-1-a14f3e51-9e3d-4cb5-bc68-d89d95c82244) from Stash, and had a blast trying each flavor. The citrus ones were better over ice on a hot day, the floral flavors were better hot on a chilly morning. And the best part is this flavor tricks my brain into thinking I'm having a snack, which keeps me out of the fridge while I work from home. Granted, I don't promote skipping meals as a form of eating healthy, but a hot cup of cinnamon tea with a bit of honey makes for a nice ""dessert"".  


 I started with a sugar cube in my cup, but now I drink every glass with no added sugar or cream. Sometimes I'll try cinnamon or allspice to experiment. Last night I got tipsy by adding a pumpkin spice tea bag and some smoky mezcal to my hot cocoa and it was **fantastic**. Usually I switch between some kind of citrus (lemon, mango, orange), a stonefruit (apricot or peach), a floral flavor (rose, lavender, bergamot), and a spice like chai.   


We tend get introduced to the most bland flavors and get turned off when really there's a whole world of healthy flavor for you to jump into. Especially now that the weather is getting colder, and we start to fantasize about heavier meals without the motivation to go outdoors, maybe consider giving tea a second chance.",eatcheapandhealthy

My current sandwich recipe is 2 slices of whole grain bread (I use Oroweat Oatnut bread, but if you know of a cheaper or healthier bread option please let me know!) sliced turkey from the deli, and mixed greens (the mix i buy has spinach, chard, and kale) with  mayonnaise and it comes out to less than $2 per sandwich. I eat them for lunch during the week because they are very simple and cheap and I can keep the few ingredients in the kitchen at work. 

I realize ""healthy"" is a relative term, but I'm hoping to find something that is just as filling but a bit lower calorie. Or, a similar number of calories but more nutritious. 

What condiments do you use for your sandwiches? I would love to use something either lower calorie/lower fat or at least something with healthier fats than mayonnaise. Or a condiment with a better protein/calorie ratio or more nutrients and minerals. I know that's a bit vague but I'm really open to trying anything as long as it's cheap, healthier than mayonnaise, and will taste good with turkey and greens. I would love to use avocado but it's a bit expensive to have on a sandwich every day. 

What kind of bread do you use for your sandwiches? I really enjoy my oatnut bread but I wonder if there's a better alternative. Bread in general can be very high calorie so if there's a lower calorie option that would be great. Or if there's a bread that's more fortified or nutritious, that would be a great option as well!

So far I really enjoy the fillings I currently use for my sandwich, since I buy the most nutritious mix of greens I can find, and turkey is leaner than many other sandwich meats. But I'm curious to know what y'all put on sandwiches. I'm somewhat limited in the amount of space I have to keep ingredients but if there's something really delicious and nutritious you recommend I might try it!

Ingredients:

* ½ Large Onion
* 2 Celery Ribs
* 2 Medium Carrots
* 3 - 4 Medium Sized Potatoes
   * About 1 potato per person
* 2 - 3 Tbsp of Flour
* 3 Cans of Clams (6.5oz cans)
* 2 Cups Milk
* Butter (2 Tbsp in total)
* Salt
* Lemon Juice

Tools:

* Knife
* Cutting Board
* Strainer (Optional)
* Pot
* Stirring Utensil

I think the most calorie intense ingredients are the butter, milk, and potatoes. Honestly, you could reduce the butter to 1 Tbsp and sub the potatoes with something else if you'd like (sweet potatoes, extra carrots, turnips, etc).

I'm trying to include more fish in my diet and from what I hear both anchovy and sardines are pretty cheap and very healthy options. I've never eaten sardines... What should I expect? Are they super fishy? For whole sardines, do you cut off the head, or cut it at all before cooking?

I've never bought either one before, but I like (most) fish. Do you just buy them in cans? Do they need to be cooked? Are sardines good just grilled with maybe some salt and then oil and lemon? (I only have a foreman grill, or a cast iron)

I'm unemployed and using food stamps, so the cheaper the better. I'm also not a very good cook, so the easier the better. 

Do I need much more than some bread or pasta and sauce to make a full meal with these fish?

Ingredients:
- 2 large onions (89c each)
- 3 bell peppers (99c each)
- 3 medium carrots ($2 for a 1 lb bag. I used half)
- 1 lb bag of frozen peas ($1.50) 
- 1lb bag of frozen corn ($1.50)
- 1 box of Golden Curry thingy ($4 at the Asian grocery store)
- 1 lb of ground beef ($4 on sale)
- 1.5lbs of ""stew cut"" round beef ($6)
- 1 apple ($1)
- Green onions (50c)
- water (free bc I don't pay for water). Use stock if u got leftover stock)
- Total cost: ~$25 for at least 12 servings

Steps:
1. Brown meats in batches in a large pot (salt, pepper, paprika, etc is dope) 
2. Dice onions and sauté.
3. When onions are kind of translucent, dice peppers, carrots, and apple and add it to the pot
4. Bring meat back in the pot, throw in all the curry cubes, and fill water to cover everything (usually like 4-5 cups)
5. Oh make sure you scrape up that fond
6. Once it's boiling, add the frozen peas and corn
7. Bring back to boil and turn down to simmer
8. Simmer that bad boy for 15 min
9. Green onions to garnish. Optional Sriracha on top.

It's simple and can be served with a variety of things 8/10 with rice. I personally like to eat it over noodles. I've tried it on a hotdog and it's really good (think chili cheese dog but with curry). It also freezes pretty well, so you can keep it for a while. I can stretch this pot of curry out for an entire week's worth of meals if I want (2 meals a day * 7 days). If you have chicken cutlets or other meats, it goes well on top of it as well. It's decent as an omelet topping. It's OK to not season ingredients as you go bc the curry cube thing is super salty.

I'm not exaggerating when I say that I *try* to eat a carrot every year and end up dry heaving over my sink. If I don't like something, I will dry heave and drool uncontrollably until I can brush my teeth. 

That said, I can change and eat some new things. I recently started eating tomato soup and stopped picking the diced tomatoes out of chili, success!

My diet is essentially heavily processed foods that are sugar, protein, or carb heavy. Fats automatically included there. Common foods include:

Breakfast: cereal (chips ahoy, count chocula, cocoa pebbles, etc.) or a clif kids bar (the protein one with 5g of protein)

Lunch: pizza, chicken nuggets, cheddar perogies, taquitos, Ramen, turkey sandwich (just turkey), or dinner leftovers

Dinner: manwich, chili, tomato soup, baked chicken, Mac and cheese, turkey, tacos, bean dip, or something from the lunch category. Might be paired with homemade mashed potatoes and microwave broccoli. 

I like to make my own food when I have time, which is more now with my schedule, so I am open to new recipes. I just need some help to find healthier alternatives. I will only eat select veggies like corn, potatoes, broccoli, and now tomatoes in some foods. Carrots have to be mushy in a soup. Fruits aren't filling so I end up not eating them, but strawberries, bananas, and apples are palatable.

Can you recommend some salad dressings please,4,jbc5so,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/jbc5so/can_you_recommend_some_salad_dressings_please/,29,1602746943.0,"So I enjoy eating salads since I’m trying to lose weight and they taste good the veg I use are normally anything I have in the fridge, so I the dressing I like are mainly acidic ones such as: 

Lemon juice

Olive oil

Parsley

Garlic 

That one was my go to dressing but I got bored of it and since I like my dressing kinda thick it would always split since there was no emulsion and I was having like 2 tables spoon worth of oil which racked up the calories 

So I made another one which I quite like 

Yoghurt
 
Lemon juice
 
Red onion 

Parsley 

Sun dried tomato and the oil 

Garlic 

I like this one a lot since it was creamy but it was hard to get it as acidic I like 

I’v heard of things like djon mustard but I’ve never tried since I don’t like yellow mustard and I don’t like balsamic vinegar as well 

So yeah can any of you recommend me some dressing based of my preferences sorry for such a long post

The beans all sank to the bottom, making proportions highly variable. My first bowl was artichoke heavy and bean light, second was more balanced. I tried “scooping from the bottom” the second scoop of the first bowl but still ended up with a lot of the top layer.

BPA and variety Question,2,jaj534,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/jaj534/bpa_and_variety_question/,7,1602642021.0,"Hello,  
I'm currently doing a workout routine (Insanity) and eat a lot of food. I still am usually a bit hungry when I go to bed. I'm also in grad school and my life is pretty busy so I don't want to cook too much. Next semester will be worse since I'm drawing near the end. I don't really care if it tastes good or not, I just don't want to be hungry. I have a lot of Great Values cans in my diet. I go for cans that have no salt or sugar added to them. Next summer I plan on doing more farmer's market and a grocery store Co-Op to get more bulk food. I also try to steer away from plastics when possible.  


My current diet consists of   
Meal 1: 3 eggs or Wheat Protein drink, can of sweet peas, can of green beans, banana.  
Meal 2: Can of fruit (Pears/Peaches/Oranges/Pineapple or Fruit cocktail), a bunch of chicken breasts and two/three spoon fulls of peanut butter. Maybe some chocolate as a treat sometimes.   


I plan on rotating a variety of meat (maybe add fish and hamburger). Do I need to add more variety to vegetables? If so, how much more? Should I add brown rice/oatmeal to the mix or some other dry food variety? Also is it bad that I have so much daily cans? The fruit cans say non intended BPA and vegetables make no mention of BPA. I'm anxious a bit now because I read online that too much chicken can cause cancer. Also too much protein can cause cancer. Also BPA can cause cancer. I was the caregiver to my mom before she passed away from cancer this year, so I'm a bit more nervous about food and exercise than I used to be.

I make just enough so I don’t have leftovers (otherwise I’d eat it all!) but it would probably make a good meal the next day! I’ll give you my eyeballed measurements but you can adjust to your liking.

You’ll need

1-2 cups of pasta, depending on how hungry you are

A handful, maybe a quarter cup, of shredded cheddar cheese. I specifically use Food Club brand from Matherne’s (Louisiana chain) because it melts beautifully and doesn’t do that weird gloopy gluey thing many brands do. If you have a favorite brand of cheese, use that instead!

A little drizzle of your favorite salsa. I use a mild salsa verde!

Salt to taste (season your pasta water though PLEASE!)

Cracked black pepper to taste

Optional toppings- leftover veggies or meats, I sometimes top mine with a fried egg

Make pasta according to package instructions. Drain but don’t shake it too much in the strainer, as you’ll want to keep some of that starchy water for the sauce. Mix in your cheese until it’s incorporated. Add salsa afterwards to thin the sauce out, or to taste. Add salt and pepper and top with your favorite toppings.

I recently made this for my family and we all (including my toddlers!) loved it. The only thing we felt was missing were potatoes. I was skeptical when I saw that ketchup was an ingredient but the end result was really delicious.

**INGREDIENTS**

1 head of green cabbage, cut into shreds

1lb of meat (we used pork but this would be tasty with chicken or beef if that’s what you have on hand) cut into bite-sized pieces 

6 medium carrots, shredded

2 small yellow onions, diced

4 TBSP ketchup

4 TBSP neutral-tasting oil

salt + pepper

**METHOD**


1. Preheat oven to 350°F. On the stove, cook meat on a preheated skillet until it turns white, then add your diced onion and continue to cook both meat and onions til the meat is just browned and the onion is translucent. Remove from heat. 

2. In a large bowl, toss the cabbage and carrots until well-mixed. Mix together the ketchup and oil and drizzle mixture over the cabbage and carrots, then toss again. Add meat and onions, toss a third time.

3. Dump your bowl of cabbage + carrots + meat + onions into a 3-5qt baking dish. Cover the baking dish with foil and bake for 30 minutes. Lower the heat to 320°F, then cook for an hour. Check to see if the cabbage is soft, and cook for a little bit longer if needed.

My other classes are virtual, so I'm literally in the same room for like 8 hours a day. Does anyone know of any good savory and healthyish dry snacks I could keep at school? I had peanut butter pretzels, but they kind of upset my stomach. I don't have a fridge. I'm kind of just looking for something I could keep right outside the lab and snack on during late nights, but that isn't going to make me feel icky for eating. I came across the cauliflower ""cheez it's""-- are those any good? Any other ideas?

ETA: Thanks guys! Trail mix seems to be my best bet (but still taking suggestions)! The main conflict here is that I never really know when it's going to be a late night ahead of time, so I need something that can just kind of sit there in a container for like a week+ without worrying about it going bad.",eatcheapandhealthy

What to eat?

To get an idea of how serious it is: I can't smell coffee, freshly minced garlic, cigarette smoke, fresh basil or any other smell even when they are very strong like the ones mentioned.

This of course affects my taste. I can taste the basic tastes (sweet, sour, salty, bitter and umami) but nothing else really. Fruit drinks taste like sugary water, no fruit detectable. Texture can be really off putting (I tried eating spaghetti today and it was horrendous, like eating flavourless worms). Foods that I normally love are awful. I ate walnuts and spat them out immediately, all I could taste was bitter, no nice nutty roasted aromas, just bitter.

I am a HUGE food lover and I even study Food Innovation. My (temporary) loss of smell has made such a huge impact.

If anyone has any experience with this, please let me know some tips on how to eat properly. I am so hungry all day long but I'm just scared to stick something in my mouth. Been eating toast a lot because I like the texture and the taste is very plain.

Looking for some more nutritional options without too weird textures and no herbs/garlic/aromatic seasonings because I can't taste them anyway.

"Eggs are so versatile and make a cheap, protein packed, filling meal. Most weeks I make an omelet/pancake based meal. Countries around the world have their own versions so they're a different flavour each time. See post for several recipe ideas from around the world.",3116,j8inij,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/j8inij/eggs_are_so_versatile_and_make_a_cheap_protein/,265,1602356831.0,"Sometimes the pancake/omelette is a one-pan meal, other times I do make side dishes to make the meal more filling and nutritious. If you don't like the texture or want more variety, most of these would also work as scrambled egg!

I have a small breakfast on my diet, but enjoy breakfast food, especially bacon, so having a breakfast dinner means I can get the breakfast flavours in a big meal. I like to make a classic style omelette filled with bacon, mushroom and cheese. Sautee the mushrooms in a separate pan and grill the bacon. Mix two or three eggs in a pan with melted butter. Add your filling before folding over. Use low fat mature cheese for maximum flavour for minimal calories. To make it more nutritious you can serve with grilled tomatoes or beans (as in British Heinz baked beans!). If you want to bulk it out cheaply and you're not as worried about calories as I, then serve with toast or hash browns.

Another British classic is toad-in-the-hole which is sausages baked in a Yorkshire pudding which is essentially crepe mixture. You can use vegetarian sausages which tend to be lower calorie than most meaty sausages. for recipes see: https://www.bbc.co.uk/food/search?q=toad+in+the+hole

You can spice toad-in-the-hole up by using flavoured sausages, add in some sliced chilis, onion and peppers. Or just make it herby with some sage & onion stuffing mixture.

From my Wagamama cookbook is okonomiyaki. Fry a couple of slices of chopped bacon with finely sliced cabbage in a little oil. Make pancake batter, per person: 2 large eggs, 150ml milk, 50g plain flour, 1 tablespoon vegetable oil, whisked together. Once the cabbage is softened, add some extra oil, wait for it to heat up and then add the pancake mixture. While it's still soft, sprinkle over sliced spring onion (scallion) or reserve these to serve, I prefer to cook them slightly. Flip to make sure it cooks on both sides. You could also add prawns or use left over meat such as shredded chicken. I added some soy sauce and Worcestershire sauce to the pancake batter. The recipe says 50g of cabbage per person but you can bulk it out with more if you want.

Another version I like which is a bit of a mish-mash of cuisines is to use chorizo. You don't need a lot as it's full of flavour, so a £2 chorizo will make up to 8 portions of food. Slice it fine and add to a dry pan on a low heat. Let the fat render off and turn the heat to medium to fry red onion and sweet peppers. Maybe add a little more oil and seasoning. Then add your eggs/pancake mixture.

From Spain is the Spanish omelette. Simply eggs, onion and potato if you follow a traditional recipe. You can add bell pepper or mushroom and extra seasoning if you want to make it a one-pan meal with some extra vitamins. Or serve with a stuffed pepper/mushroom. Sometimes I use sweet potato instead of white!

There's also frittata which is like a crustless quiche packed with veggies! This can be made in a pan or baked in the oven. I bake them in silicone cupcake cases for lunches or a picnic. In a bowl mix together egg and some cheese. I like to use goat's cheese and a bit of grated cheddar. You can add all sorts of grated or finely chopped veg: beetroot, spinach, onion, mushroom, courgette. And also season with complimentary herbs, parsley is nice with beetroot. Bake at about 180-200c for about 15 minutes. I usually throw these in while I'm cooking dinner one night and then they'll keep in the fridge a few days. If you prefer them warm you can then just nuke them in the microwave.",eatcheapandhealthy

The other reason is I wanna eat more healthy and lose weight. I already lost some this summer because the effects Covid has on a fat person is really scary and I'm actively trying not to catch it (I live with someone who's immunocompromised) but I wanna accelerate that weight loss more, with healthier and affordable options. Whole Foods is out of the question, that place is waaaay overpriced and long term isn't sustainable for my budget or wallet lol. Maybe if I was upper middle class or rich I'd be shopping there exclusively but no such luck.

I'm looking for meat alternatives that cost less than real meat and that last at least a week or two in my fridge, portion-wise. I'll still buy my usual dairy products, I'll still eat cheese and eggs (which I don't consume much anyway) but I really wanna cut down on meat the most if there are affordable options that offer the exact same daily nutrients that chicken or beef offers, for example. This will be a long term project for me that hopefully yields healthy results and makes me succesful in my career later in life. Maybe there's an app dedicated to plant based products and deals? I'm open to suggestions.

I should mention I'm from Canada so I shop at Freshco for my groceries. I'm also unemployed at the moment due to Covid lockdown layoffs and on those CERB benefits.

1. Lentil spinach soup 

It's a recipe by the cooking book author Ravinder Bhogal.

Cook a cup of red lentils with some butter, salt and pepper in around a liter of water until soft (around 15 minutes).

In a pan heat some vegetable oil and fry a diced onion until tender. Add lemon zest of one lemon and at least two cloves of chopped garlic and toast for a minute. Add the mixture to the lentils.

Wash two handfuls of fresh spinach and throw into the soup. Turn off the heat. The spinach will cook within a minute. Add lemon juice to taste

Enjoy!

2. Turkish lentil soup 

This is my take on the classic Turkish lentil soup. 

Dice an onion, a carrot and a potato. Heat some olive oil and fry the vegetables for some minutes over medium heat. Add chopped garlic and a cup of red lentils. Add cumin, salt and chili to taste. Cover with hot water. Cook over low heat until soft. Blend and add chopped parsley and lemon juice to taste.

Enjoy!

So I’m guessing I need to use some combo of spices to really give it some flavor that you would expect as a restaurant or whatever.

I didn’t use corn starch, I think I prefer it without.

Any suggestions for spices to use to flavor tofu? Also, what is a good mix of vegetables to cook with those spices too? Thanks!",eatcheapandhealthy

What are your vegetarian recipes for someone who has a lifelong eating disorder?,0,j59hsn,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/j59hsn/what_are_your_vegetarian_recipes_for_someone_who/,20,1601885303.0,"Hi guys,

I’m an insane lifelong picky eater. I’m 24 and I’ve eaten a lot of my food out of the microwave. My girlfriend has brought to my attention that i have an eating disorder, which I didn’t realize (I’m kind of a ditz haha). I like super easy to make meals, like microwave quesadillas. I don’t find a lot of enjoyment out of food, to be honest. I’ve been trying to slow down when I eat, because if I could live off of slamming down tortillas and cheese I would, because you just throw some cheese on a tortilla and pop it in the microwave for a minute and it’s done. It’s been cheap on my wallet and it gets me by through the day but I need nutrients and I need to treat my body better (I’m underweight, as I have learned). A lot of my diet is quesadillas and Morningstar veggies patties. Because they’re easy and quick, and I know I need to change my diet. 

So Im trying to be healthier! I’ve gotten oatmeal, I have been eating peanut butter and carrots together as a snack, I’ve got kale (that I’m gonna throw in a frying pan and then put it in a quesadilla). The other morning I put broccoli and cheese together in a bowl in the microwave! So baby steps. Im starting to get seasonings for some foods, like putting sriracha or black pepper or red peppers in stuff too. 

I’ve kinda got social anxiety! I have two roommates who are nice but they hang out a lot in the living room. I’m nervous about cooking in front of them, and eating in front of them. It’s just been a lifelong thing of mine, and I think eventually I’ll feel comfortable cooking in front of them.

So what im trying to ask for is if you guys have any healthy, easy meals to make that are kinda quick to make? I would really appreciate any insight you have. I don’t have a lot of people I feel comfortable asking so i really appreciate any ideas. I don’t like soups and I’m afraid of boiling things. Honestly I’m afraid of fire in general, but I can manage a frying pan okay haha. I really do not fuck with ovens. The reason is kinda pathetic, it’s because I have no depth perception so I tend to not understand where exactly things are in the world. I have burned myself a few times because I don’t know where precisely the hot object or liquid is haha! 

Anyways sorry for the novel, and thank you in advance for any ideas you have!

I'm thinking more like things where you cut and measure out everything but it's all uncooked until the time when you actually want to eat it. I do not like meal prep because I never like the food that tastes like leftovers rather than a fresh meal.

I have 30 or so minutes for my lunch breaks and I'm working from home, so things that I can cut and prep in advance but not cook in advance, and then cook during my lunch break for a fully freshly cooked meal is what I'm looking for.

The sort of things I've done are like chopping up peppers and onion and spinach and sticking it in the fridge until I want to make an omelet with those veggies. Instead of taking 20 minutes to prep and cook everything it takes 10. Or cooking a couple cups of rice (one of the pre-cooked exceptions because it still takes totally fine for a full week) and having prepped veggies to make a quick stir fry.

So basically I just need ideas for things that are quick to cook after you have everything prepped.

**Why I Made This Thread**

Yesterday, /u/MikeGrowsGreens posted a thread, [If you can, grow your own lettuce and microgreens](https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/j4lncx/if_you_can_grow_your_own_lettuce_and_microgreens/), in which he explained that it’s just not that hard to grow your own food.

Several comments were critical, and I posted a few times in defense of the notion that gardening does not have to be as complicated as folks make it out to be. After I slept on it, I found I had a lot more to say. I believe it merits its own post, so here we are. Hope you agree.

Nothing in my life has helped me to eat cheap and healthy more than gardening has. I’m in the best shape of my life, and gardening is why. I’ve written this because I hope others will benefit. I wish I had known all of this years ago.

**My Background**

I was raised in a college town by parents who were born and raised in the city. We did not garden.

*Their* parents had all been raised around gardening. Each of them had grown up poor, and they gardened to survive. They grew corn so they could eat corn and not starve.

As adults in the post-WWII era, they moved to the city, the men got pretty good jobs, and they took pride in the fact that they could afford to pay for other people to grow their food. As such, my parents were not exposed to gardening.

In my town, only the quirky gardened. It was a niche hobby. No one *needed* to garden. What’s the matter with just going to the grocery store? I couldn’t understand it.

Furthermore, it looked like *so much work*, and such an *expensive* hobby. Buying a tiller. Preparing the beds just so. Building trellises. Tying plants up just so. Fertilizing in just the right way with expensive fertilizers. Vigilant searches for pests. Expensive pesticides. Who had the time and money for that?

About a decade ago, I moved to the country with my wife and our kids, back to where she was born and raised. Over time, I’ve befriended many gardeners, hunters, foragers. It’s not as weird here.

**The Gift Covid Gave Me**

Like you, I experienced a pandemic this year. Early on, my priority was to increase self-sufficiency. It provided me a sense of control over the situation, I suppose. I was concerned that supply chains could break down, and I wanted to ensure that if worse came to worse, my family and my neighbors would be able to eat. So I decided to dip my toes into gardening.

On that last trip to the stores, the one where I had to go to three places before I found a package of toilet paper, I stocked up on medicines, bought a backup water filtration system (I backpack, so I already had some, but water’s important), and I bought ten to fifteen seed packets.

And then I didn’t do anything with them. Looking back, I think I was just too intimidated, because I had internalized the belief that gardening is hard. Hell, I’ve watched my neighbor agonize over his garden for years. He’ll talk for as long as you care to listen about all of the problems that come with gardening. The labor. The expense. The pests. The diseases. The failures.

Plus, I was kind of stressed about the whole pandemic thing. 

Eventually, one of my sons was experiencing cabin fever and just looking for a good excuse to be outside and away from the rest of our quarantining family, and he asked if I minded if he got some of those seeds going. He spent about an hour on the task, having never done it before. He started spinach, kale, mustard, broccoli, and a variety of herbs.

He watered them occasionally until he headed back to his place in the city. As we learned more about the virus and how folks were going to be responding to it around here, he decided he was just as safe in his own place, and frankly it can be kind of frustrating to live with your parents as a young adult. So the seedlings became my responsibility. I didn’t really do much. I watered a few times.

A couple weeks later, I could tell these little plants were running out of room in their seed pods, so I transplanted them into the spot my wife had used for gardening years back and paid them very little mind. But a few weeks later, I wandered over to them and found that I had greens to harvest. I was gardening.

**How to Get Started**

Around that time, I had the good fortune to stumble across two YouTube videos that I still point people to when they express interest in getting started: [Basil, How To Grow More Than You Can Eat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byoEBdVoVpM) and [5 Fast Growing Veggies You Can Harvest in Under 1 Month](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEt_120VEAM). In the latter video, Kevin talks about the importance of getting a win, and I could not agree more. 

I used to believe in the notion of a green thumb. And that I didn’t have one.

I love the outdoors. My favorite vacation spots are wilderness areas. One of my life-long goals is to visit each U.S. scenic national park. So, naturally, I like the idea of having houseplants.

But I’m terrible at keeping houseplants alive. At this point, I mostly have pothos, because they like to be ignored. We’re a good fit.

Now that I have some gardening experience, I’ve come to realize that I’m not good with houseplants because it doesn’t gel with my overall philosophy, which is to grow plants in alignment with nature. Houseplants tend to be varieties that grow naturally in humid tropical environments. I live in the midwestern U.S., and I like to keep my windows open, even in the winter.

As I’ve learned more over the last several months, I’ve observed that many expert houseplant growers don’t much care for gardening outdoors. My guess is that for the person who likes to learn exactly the right pH for a particular plant, precisely the right nutrients at just the right time to optimize houseplant growth, gardening outdoors is extremely frustrating. Natural forces are hard to battle.

But for those like me who find the processes of nature fascinating, gardening outdoors is a delight. Even when you ‘lose’ plants to bugs or disease or whatever. Delightfully fascinating.

**Natural Gardening**

Once I experienced a bit of success, I was hooked. I watched every gardening video I could find. 

I had the good fortune to come across [this video about Masanobu Fukuoka](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2goMfMEf6TY), and I knew straight away this was for me. 

Here is an excerpt from his book, [*The One-Straw Revolution*](https://www.amazon.com/One-Straw-Revolution-Introduction-Natural-Classics/dp/1590173139):

> The usual way to go about developing a method is to ask ""How about trying this?"" or ""How about trying that?"" bringing in a variety of techniques one upon the other. This is modern agriculture and it only results in making the farmer busier.

> My way was opposite. I was aiming at a pleasant, natural way of farming which results in making the work easier instead of harder. ""How about not doing this? How about not doing that?"" - that was my way of thinking. I ultimately reached the conclusion that there was no need to plow, no need to apply fertilizer, no need to make compost, no need to use insecticide. When you get right down to it, there are few agricultural practices that are really necessary.

It occurred to me that this is just how I think about how I do my job. I’m an educator, and I’ve been told over and over again that I should be doing *this* or *that*, and when I point out that my students are successful without those things, I’m told that I’m lucky. I’m fifteen years in at this point. That’s a lot of luck.

No, just as I conceptualize education, the philosophy of natural gardening is to be mostly an observer. A gentle facilitator of natural processes. 

Fukuoka was roundly criticized for his farming practices. The book is worth a read. He goes into his thoughts as to why his practices were not adopted by other farmers, despite the fact that his yields were comparable with far less labor and expense.

> And so one may ask why this truth has not spread. I think that one of the reasons is that the world has become so specialized that it has become impossible for people to grasp anything in its entirety. For example, an expert in insect damage prevention from the Kochi Prefectural Testing Center came to inquire why there were so few rice leaf-hoppers in my fields even though I had not used insecticide. Upon investigating the habitat, the balance between insects and their natural enemies, the rate of spider propagation and so on, the leaf-hoppers were found to be just as scarce in my fields as in the Center’s fields, which are sprayed countless times with a variety of deadly chemicals.

> The professor was also surprised to find that while the harmful insects were few, their natural predators were far more numerous in my fields than in the sprayed fields. Then it dawned on him that the fields were being maintained in this state by means of a natural balance established among the various insect communities. He acknowledged that if my method were generally adopted, the problem of crop devastation by leaf-hoppers could be solved. He then got into his car and returned to Kochi.

> But if you ask whether or not the testing center’s soil fertility or crop specialists have come here, the answer is no, they have not. And if you were to suggest at a conference or gathering that this method, or rather non-method, be tried on a wide scale, it is my guess that the prefecture or research station would reply, “Sorry, it’s too early for that. We must first carry out research from every possible angle before giving final approval.” It would take years for a conclusion to come down.

> This sort of thing goes on all the time. Specialists and technicians from all over Japan have come to this farm. Seeing the fields from the standpoint of his own specialty, every one of these researchers has found them at least satisfactory, if not remarkable. But in the five or six years since the professor from the research station came to visit here, there have been few changes in Kochi Prefecture.

I took Fukuoka’s ideas to heart. I bought more seeds. I found a few plants at a farmer’s market, brought them home, and popped them in the ground. Then I watched.

**What to Buy**

If I were to start from scratch today, here is what I would buy:

* [seed pods](https://www.amazon.com/Seedling-Starter-Trays-720-Cells/dp/B00BRQ3QWK)
* soil - I like [this kind](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01508YKY8)
* seeds - I recommend [MIgardener](https://migardener.com/shop/) (inexpensive, fewer options) and [Baker Creek](https://www.rareseeds.com/) (more expensive, more options)
* a trowel

For real, that’s it. And truth be told, the seed pods and soil are optional. I just find them convenient and worth the expense.

**What You Need to Know**

One super useful piece of information is your growing zone. I don’t know exactly how you’d go about that outside the States, but I bet it’s not that tricky. For me, I used the [USDA Plant Hardiness Zone Map](https://planthardiness.ars.usda.gov/PHZMWeb/). Knowing your zone will help you to choose plants that are likely to work in your environment.

It’s also good to know your location’s average first and last frost dates. All I did was google it for my zip code.

This information matters, because different plants thrive in different environments. I’m just about a week away from my average first frost date, so I won’t be starting tomatoes right now. I won’t be starting squash. Frost kills these.

But frost doesn’t kill everything. In fact, a lot of plants like frost. You can still plant right now. 

Everything you need to know is on YouTube. My favorites: [James Prigioni](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9V_-gqJsZNOy4v_HqbRz3w), [Charles Downing](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCB1J6siDdmhwah7q0O2WJBg), [Gardener Scott](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWsI0LmiDyezbnN2JCL4P9w), and [Liz Zorab](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCe0Ha5QljsCV5UqIkobBrcQ).

I also highly recommend the book [The Four-Season Harvest](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1890132276), by Eliot Coleman. He argues that gardeners are mistaken when they conceptualize the year as growing season vs. not growing season. It can always be growing season.

**Won’t My Plants Die if I’m Not an Expert?**

Yep. Some of them will. My suggestion is to accept this up front. Plan for it. 

Again, I liken it to my teaching philosophy. If I allow students to make their own choices, won’t they make mistakes? Yep, they will. I account for that in my overall planning. The benefits outweigh the downsides, and it’s not close.

In my garden, I account for inevitable loss by planting a lot, and often. I don’t spend a lot of energy on the precise right date to put in new plants. Instead, I start seeds and see what happens. A week or two later, I start new seeds. The ones that didn’t come up last time? Maybe I start another round of those.

I advocate this not because it is perfect. No, I advocate this because it is a solution to decision paralysis. If you’re like me, it’s hard to start without knowing exactly what to do. It’s overwhelming, and you just don’t start.

The most important bit is *to start*. You’ll gain expertise over time.

Early in the summer, I joined several gardening groups in my state. Most of the posts went like this: 

* Here is a picture of a bug on my plant. What do I do?

* First comment: That’s an *a* bug. Kill it with *b*.

* Second comment: No, that’s a *c* bug. Kill it with *d*.

Well, following Fukuoka’s advice, I just let nature take its course. I planted squash, so I got squash bugs. I planted brassicas, so I got cabbage moths. I planted tomatoes, so I got hornworms.

I left them alone and just watched to see what happened.

Some of the plants died. But some didn’t. In fact, some grew back even stronger after the bugs had run their course.

At some point I decided to try adding some flowers to encourage predatory insects and birds to visit my garden to help out with the bugs, with the overall goal being to create, as closely as possible, a full, thriving ecosystem.

Turns out hummingbirds like zinnias. I’ll plant them again next year for sure.

**Why Do So Many Expert Gardeners Disagree With This Philosophy?**

That’s an interesting question to me. I suspect it’s mostly confirmation bias, and it’s why I included my backstory back up at the top of this post. I think it’s actually been to my benefit that I wasn’t raised by gardeners, because I didn’t have anything to unlearn.

Without edging too far into geopolitical territory, I think it’s fair to say that anytime anyone is doing anything, someone is going to try to make a buck off of it.

So, yes, an entire industry has developed around gardening. Buy this to increase yield. Buy that to prevent pests.

I decided this year to do none of it. Again, following Fukuoka, I constantly asked, ‘what if I don’t do that?’ 

There are a couple things I will do differently next year. One, I will probably build a trellis for my tomatoes. I did eat a lot of tomatoes this year, with the plants just sprawling out on the ground. But they were pretty susceptible to disease, and a number of them rotted because they were on the ground. Two, I’ll probably trellis at least some of my cucumbers as well. They did fantastic on the ground - I ate a cucumber a day for about two months - but they took up a lot of space. 

But I still do not intend to fight pests or disease in any way other than trying to build that complete ecosystem.

My best guess as to why long-term gardeners look at my comments and think of me as naive and ignorant is the same reason I get that feedback from fellow educators. They’ve been doing it the hard way for so long, it’s damn near impossible for them to admit to themselves that they’ve been working themselves to the bone for no reason.

You’ve seen this where you work, right? The person who’s been doing the same job the same way for 20 years, and even though you can see that instead of spending six hours, they could do it differently in five minutes, they won’t hear you. You don’t know. You haven’t been there.

Well, this is one of those situations.

When my neighbor sees aphids, he digs in his books to find the ways to kill aphids. He hates them. When he sees squash bugs, he unleashes an attack on squash bugs. After he applies his treatment, they go away. He has won.

But here’s the thing. Mine went away too. At least *try* not doing anything.

**Final Thoughts**

I hope this post is useful to you. Gardening has changed my life. I have spent my entire life overweight and out of shape, and my best guess is that it’s because I’ve been in a micronutrient deficit my whole life, causing me to feel hungry even though I’d eaten plenty of calories. My body wanted nutrients.

I eat fresh vegetables every day now. And while, no, they’re not free, they are cheap. Cheap and healthy. Win win.

A year ago I posted one of my favorite make-it-a-meal methods, which is basically an bastardized version of dolsot bibimbap.  Today I have another bastardized meal for you, variations on shakshuka (could also be compared to eggs in purgatory).  To me, some of the most useful skills in eating cheap & healthy are **confidence and flexibility** \- recognize the most important elements of a dish, then use what you have to make a limited pantry work, or just to add some variety.  This method, rather than strict recipe, reflects that.

1. **Sauté some onions and garlic.**  (Type of onion doesn't matter.  Prep doesn't really matter either - I usually chop my onions, but sometimes I've used sliced and that's fine as well. Ditto the sautéing material - use butter or olive oil or canola oil, whatever, it's gonna be fine) **Optional additions:** hard vegetables such as peppers, carrots, or cabbage. (add at the same time as the onions)
2. **Add some spices.**  **Options to consider:** paprika, cumin, red pepper flakes, oregano, turmeric, curry powder, za'atar, harissa, gochujang, sambal oelek.  Obviously don't add all of those together, but you get the idea.  The flavor is flexible, go with what you like & have on hand.  If you're very hesitant about proportions & combinations, Smitten Kitchen has a good shakshuka recipe that you can look up as a standard baseline.
3. **Add some tomatoes.**  They can be canned or fresh, diced or smashed, I've ever seen some people say they just use plain tomato sauce (this one's texture seems iffy to me but whatever floats your boat).  I use ""regular"" tomatoes but have heard of it done with cherry tomatoes, Roma tomatoes, tomatillos..... you get the idea.  Simmer over medium heat until their juices start to thicken into a saucy consistency.  **Optional additions:** cooked carb-y grains like chickpeas, lentils, rice... AND/OR leafy vegetables like kale, swiss chard, spinach.  Whatever you're adding, you will probably want to add it in after the tomatoes have simmered a little bit so that they don't get overcooked, but not at the very very end because they need a little time to warm up and/or wilt.
4. **Add some eggs.** Crack them on top of the whole thing.  Cover and cook for \~4 minutes, until the whites are cooked through but the yolks are still runny.
5. **Add some toppings/serve-alongs.  Options to consider:** parsley, basil, cilantro, cheese (parmesan, cotija, feta...), avocado, sour cream, yogurt, toast, flatbread, tortilla chips.  Again, obviously don't use all of these - try to keep in mind the flavor profile that you've already made with your spices & choice of tomatoes, and pick a couple additions that will enhance that.

So for example, today I used (1) some sliced red onions and minced garlic sautéed in veg oil (2) with paprika, cumin, & red pepper flakes and (3) a can of diced tomatoes and (4) 4 eggs with (5) buttered toast.  It was a very basic version of it, but tasty and filling.  

Another example - I have made it with (1) diced yellow onion, diced jalapeno pepper, & minced garlic sautéed in veg oil (2) with paprika, cumin, & za'atar and (3) canned crushed tomatoes, canned chickpeas, and fresh chopped kale and (4) 2 eggs with (5) yogurt and more za'atar. This is heartier & feels like a different meal thanks to a few changes.

This can be served for breakfast, lunch, or dinner.  It is ready to eat in less than half an hour.  I hope that the ideas here are helpful. Happy cooking! :-)",eatcheapandhealthy

I'm disabled (cognitive issues and extreme chronic fatigue) and have to live on a ridiculously tight budget. I need to be able to eat healthier, but I also can't really cook anything that has more than a few steps involved. Most meal guides I find involve making a lot of stuff from scratch, which isn't super viable for me. To give an idea of where I'm at - on a good day, if I want to also get some work done at my job, I can cook one meal from scratch and *maybe* do one other chore (As in, keeping one room relatively clean, or doing one load of laundry, something like that). And of course not every day is a good day, so I need things that I'll be able to pretty much just grab and eat in bed in a pinch. 

I am slowly but surely putting together a decent meal plan for myself, but I can always use more tips! So, any ideas?",eatcheapandhealthy

Quinoa “porridge”,3,j4vdw7,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/j4vdw7/quinoa_porridge/,4,1601827591.0,"For 4 portions:

500ml milk of choice
170g quinoa

Rinse the quinoa with water, add milk and rinsed quinoa to pot. Bring to a boil and then lower heat and simmer with the lid on for 20 minutes or until most of the milk is absorbed. Remove from heat and allow to sit for 5 minutes. From there, you can do what you like. The recipe I followed used fresh blueberries (200g), ginger powder (1/4 tsp), nutmeg (1/4tsp), some chopped pecans and maple syrup (2tbsp). 

To make it cheaper, I used frozen blueberries I had instead of fresh and added sliced apple, as they’re in season, to bulk it out. Also added 1/2 pecans and 1/2 walnuts as the walnuts are cheaper for me. 

It’s a nice breakfast, feels much lighter than porridge. It cost about £1-£1.20 per portion and this is a cheap breakfast, considering I live in a very expensive country. For example, Tesco sell 300g quinoa for £2 and I paid almost £5 for 400g.",eatcheapandhealthy

[https://youtu.be/\_htmF5GpPPM](https://youtu.be/_htmF5GpPPM) 

I am also not sponsored or paid by them in any way, just thought their recipe could benefit from some tips and tricks. Plus $8 a meal for something that's homecooked seems kinda pricey imo.

Ingredients:

* 8 Oz Mushrooms
* 2 Cloves of Garlic
* 4 Green Onions/Scallions
* 20 oz Chicken Breast Strips
* 1 Tbsp dried Italian Seasoning
* 8 Oz Cream Sauce Base
   * Sub with Canned Coconut Milk for no Dairy
   * Sub Evaporated Skim Milk or Milk for less calories, but will need to reduce sauce for longer
* 1 Tbsp Stock Concentrate OR Soy Sauce
* ½ Cup Parmesan Cheese
   * Sub with Nutritional Yest for no Dairy
   * Sub with Sun-dried tomatoes for less calories
* Oil
* Butter
* Salt & Pepper

Tools:

* Knife
* Cutting Board
* Paper Towels
* Frying Pan
* Large Pot
* Stirring Utensil
* Strainer
* Microwave

I think the most expensive things here would be mushrooms and the parmesan cheese. Mushrooms are $2.99 for 8oz in my area, and the parm can be omitted or replaced with less expensive subs. The Dried Italian Seasonings might also be pricey depending on where you live, but you can either replace or omit that too if needed.

- in fritters
- veggie patty along with black beans, mushrooms, etc
- salad topping
- in pasta (pasta of your choice, pesto, peas, garlic, and a protein or mushroom. Goes super well with gnocchi. Also works as a filling for ravioli)
- pureed (goes as a good base for fish dishes)
- in paella (you can get a surprisingly cheap paella if you take advantage of in season fish and the frozen aisle) 
- as a dip (peas blended in hummus, a yogurt based dip with blended peas, etc. Surprisingly good in spinach artichoke dip too)

But now we have to very careful with his diet and can't be giving him his treats and stuff he likes alot anymore, we've made him a hamster soup which he seems to like consisting of couscous, barley, and some veggies such as minced broccoli, cauliflower and carrot (boiled  then broth discarded and boiled again) but it's very little in the veggie department because we're unsure if it's okay for him to be taking it in normal amounts, and we can't be giving him that entirely as it might make him not want to eat his normal hamster food (he is already quite picky as is with his food)

His hamster food has some grains, saffron seeds, oat flakes, sunflower seed and some other stuff that I can't identify.

We used to give him boiled: bean sprouts, broccoli, cauliflower, carrot, corn, baby corn, cucumber, pak choy, sweet peas, (varies usually 2 -5 different bits of them a day)

Fruits he used to eat (usually every 3 days he gets a small piece, sometimes a little bonus in between): apple, banana, papaya, pear, mango, jack fruit and watermelon, but he only had this twice.

He also had a small bit of boiled chicken every 3 days for the past few months and along with a drop or two of cod liver oil via syringe.

But now with his condition we're unsure what is still okay for him to eat, can't seem to find much of a list out there for food properties, much less so ones okay for hamsters, from the few I've seen regarding kidney disease they need to consume less phosphorus, protein, sodium and potassium.

Besides the bits of veggies in the mix we give him, he has had a few bits of banana and 2 slivers of celery, not sure if too much banana is bad for him and I've read somewhere celery is good for kidney but can't find much else mentioning anything about it, his hamster food mentions 11.0% crude protein and about 0.8% phosphorus, he can't take too little protein either of he'll lose muscle mass, but not sure how much of that 11% he takes when he is picky on his hamster food.

Don't pass up on sardines!,2531,j36g68,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/j36g68/dont_pass_up_on_sardines/,594,1601579047.0,"I am obsessively passionate about sardines as a food and they are pretty much the perfect food source.

&#x200B;

Whenever I mention them to friends/family/acquaintances they all look at me in disgust and tell me that's what they feed their cats.

&#x200B;

If you want a genuine cheap superfood (not a fad superfood) pick up a can (or 10) of sardines the next time you shop. They have extremely good benefits to heart, brain, bone and skin health thanks to their high levels of vitamin B12, selenium, phosphorous, omega 3 and calcium; providing you buy the cans with skin and bone included, both the bones and skin are unnoticeable when you eat them. They are also a very cheap and very good source of protein and even have a very decent amount of vitamin D, I mean, which other food source gives vitamin D?

&#x200B;

In a can they last for years which is perfect for the coronavirus pandemic as you will have stocks should the shop run out, also means you may have to shop less often so lower risk of infection.

&#x200B;

On top of that they are EXTREMELY cheap. A can of tuna in the UK costs around £1 yet I can buy a can of sardines in tomato sauce for 31p (Aldi), so 3 cans of sardines per can of tuna plus the health benefits are much higher.

&#x200B;

Sardines are very low in mercury thanks to being bottom of the food chain so you don't have to worry unlike tuna (most countries recommend a maximum of 2 cans of tuna per week). I'm not a qualified nutritionist and not a scientist but I've seen many sources stating tuna has 10x-20x more mercury than sardines.

&#x200B;

And to top it all off, for the environmentally aware, they are considered extremely sustainable. AFAIK they are almost never farmed and pretty much always caught wild, reproduce fast and are currently not overfished other than in some parts. They were previously overfished when canning food was new but they bounced right back.

&#x200B;

For the people who are really looking to cost cut and have no cooking ability (me), what I do personally is cook up 100g (dry) of wholewheat pasta. Drain the pasta and put it in a bowl, mush the sardines (canned in tomato sauce) into the pasta then microwave for 30 secs to a minute (just to warm the sardines) then add some pepper and if you like some hot sauce. Delicious meal costing around £0.50.

&#x200B;

Seriously, do some research and you will learn!

Ingredients (most from Asian grocery store):

* Miso
* Tofu
* Instant noodle of choice
* Soy sauce
* Frozen veggies (I like peas and corn)
* Sesame oil
* Dehydrated mushrooms (optional)
* Onion (optional)
* Gojuchang (optional, Sriracha in a pinch)
* Garlic powder (optional)

Steps:

1. (Optional) Boil water in kettle and pour over handful of dehydrated mushrooms. Let steep for 10 minutes or until mushrooms are completely hydrated. Remove mushrooms from broth and save for later.
2. While mushrooms are steeping, cut tofu into cubes.
3. Put either mushroom broth or water to boil in a pot. Add miso and season to taste with gojuchang, soy sauce, and garlic powder.
4. Once boiling add the instant noodles, tofu, and onion and cook for recommended amount of time (2-3 minutes usually for instant noodles).
5. While in pot over heat, add frozen peas and corn near the end of noodle cooking process. Also add in the mushrooms from earlier cut or whole.
6. Prepare your bowl with a dab of sesame oil and transfer noodle soup over.
7. (Optional) Top with preferred soup toppings. I personally like pickled bamboo shoots in chili oil or bean sprouts.

It's not much but it's a huge serving that's warm and tasty. Extreme bastardization of ramen or any noodle soup, but it's good and cheap. If you're not vegan, feel free to replace tofu with 1-2 eggs in style of egg drop soup or use boxed veggie/meat broth instead of dehydrated mushrooms.

Sustainable diet?,5,j248x2,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/j248x2/sustainable_diet/,7,1601430288.0,"Hello everyone, first post here so LMK if I need to change anything and I will be happy to do so!

22 Year old male who works a desk job going to be moving out of my parents house early next year and am trying to get better saving wise and eat healthier. 

I used to eat eggs for breakfast, get fast food for lunch and eat whatever my mom cooked (she always cooks so I’m fortunate to have that).

I have switched from eating eggs in favor of a cup of ‘fried’ oatmeal (I put some coconut oil in a pan and cook the oatmeal until it’s crunchy like cereal) with a cup of almond milk and blue berries every morning. 

For lunches I make chipotle style chicken (add just a pinch of salt) with black beans (no salt) with Brown rice (with no salt) and a random vegetable added in (broccoli and asparagus being my favorite) with some hot sauce added. Everything measured 1 cup evenly, tastes delicious and is super filling.

Dinner i haven’t come up with a convenient way to eat yet, I usually just stockpile on frozen ‘heathy’ burritos that are always 400 cal. Usually vegan or breakfast burritos (eggs, sausage and cheese). 

Is this a sustainable heathy diet? I’m not worried about getting tired of it, usually the kind of person who finds something they like and stick with it for a while. The whole diet is also super cost effective, 4 lbs of chicken at Kroger is about $10 and oatmeal about $3.",eatcheapandhealthy

We were so thrilled to have somewhere to live and so happy to cook for each other! (Specifically me bc I am quite good at pies and other pastries so I was excited to make them for the people I love the most)

But ... We have cockroaches :( they are definitely infesting our home and they are very very heavy in the kitchen and the bathroom. We have been extremely persistent with the management here and are about to start a 3 week pest control plan with a trusted pest person. But until the cockroaches are gone, none of us are comfortable cooking in the kitchen. I don't want to put the cookware that I love in cabinets that are literally full of roaches come nightfall. We've used the oven once for some garlic bread and that seemed fine, but we stress about using it and the microwave for fear that cockroaches will find their way in and try to survive on the microbes of food.

So we've been eating takeout pretty much every night which is getting really expensive. All food we have, leftovers/snacks/others, HAS to be stored in the fridge bc it's the only sealed place.

So we can't have anything that can't stand to be in the cold, takeout is getting expensive, and our only other option seemed to be charcuterie which can get pricy too when you're feeding three people.

Any tips for eating cheap and possibly even healthy while we go through this nightmare? Y'all think we should use the microwave???

It’s great as a side, on top of salads, with meats and the crunch adds great texture. My trick is to go to the stores to get inspiration on what to pickle and tweak it at home with what I have on hand. Veggies can include cucumbers, cauliflower, carrots, green beans, brussels sprouts, beets, the possibilities are endless.

Here is an easy recipe:

2 cups water
1 cup distilled vinegar
2 tbs salt
1 tbs peppercorns
extras: add herbs, peppers, garlic, bay leaf, anything goes!

Steps:

Stuff the veggies (and extras) in a jar and really pack them in so there’s little air space. Simmer all the ingredients (except extras) until the salt is just dissolved. Pour the hot brine directly into the jar until everything is submerged and let it cool on the counter. Move to the fridge and let it hang out for 1-2+ days. Enjoy!

Heat up olive oil in a big pot, add chopped onion. Let cook until translucent then add the minced garlic. 30 seconds later fill the pot with water and put in the whole chicken. Cook for 20 min until gunk from the chicken starts foaming. Pick up the gunk and dispose of it. Add chopped vegetables, salt pepper to taste and I also like thyme in there or a mix of fresh herbs. A lot of pepper is better.

Cook for another 30 minutes until chicken is well cooked. Serve with rice pasta (optional) to be added when hot before serving so it doesn't become gross and slimy. Add chopped parsley before serving (a must).

If you make your own sauce, that can save you a dollar.

Hummus is super cheap to make. A can of chickpeas can be less than a dollar, and from there you just need lemon juice, salt, a couple of spices and some tahini or unsweetened plant butter.  Use as a protein-packed vehicle for getting fresh vegetables into your system.

Low effort but requires some planning: meat can cost just over $2 a pound if you buy a whole chicken.  Chuck it in a slow cooker 5+ hours in advance along with potatoes, apples, carrots, whatever hearty fruits and vegetables you have on hand.  Enjoy the messy feast from the slow cooker the first night or two.  After that, you'll still have meals upon meals worth of leftovers to de-bone, freeze, use for soups, and otherwise get creative with.

Grocery stores have a huge turnover when it comes to food, especially bread and apples, and often end up throwing these away daily.  Many of them make deals with local nonprofits to distribute this food to people in need, and still a lot of it can go to waste.  Don't be ashamed to ask around about nonprofits that need people to take leftovers off their hands.  You can save good food from the trash, and cut your grocery bill in half.

When having people over, give them tea.  It's fancy, comforting, welcoming, and dirt cheap.

Frozen or canned produce is generally much cheaper than fresh, and also lasts longer.  It's also packed with nutrients because it tends to be fresher when preserved than the fresh stuff is by the time it gets to you.  The more intact canned food is (eg canned whole tomatoes instead of puree) the better quality it tends to be, because it's easier to visually identity bad food when it's whole so sellers tend to be more careful.  Use frozen or canned veg to make stir fries, soups, shepherd's pie, all kinds of stuff.  Use frozen or canned fruit to make smoothies and pies, or to add to whole grain cereal.

Dried fruit, eg raisins, makes an excellent addition to a bowl of whole grain cereal or oatmeal.  It's also generally cheaper than fresh, and the sweetness will help you avoid dumping in tons of sugar.

Make sure the dried or canned fruit doesn't have added sugar.

Mustard Style Black Eyed Peas,94,j1au9x,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/j1au9x/mustard_style_black_eyed_peas/,7,1601323956.0,"I've previously made a general bean meal prep post a few months ago, but my most recent one has been my favorite so far, and I wanted to share this specific one. I live in the Midlands of South Carolina, and the style of barbeque traditional to the region is mustard style, due to the high amount of German immigrants who brought their own tastes to the cooking technique. Mustard style is my personal favorite as well, and I was interested to see if I could pull off something like a mustard style black eyed pea. So I'll just go ahead and give you a step by step to what I did.

-Aromatics: I just used a big bag of store bought sauerkraut and fried it off in some olive oil to begin. I would've chopped an onion if I had one lying around. Cooked it for 10ish minutes just to remove the water from the cabbage. I was thinking of starting this with some salt pork I had lying around, but decided against it last second, just because I wanted to see how it'd be mostly meatless.

-Flavoring: I then made a spot in the middle of my pan to fry off some spices. I used caraway seeds, cumin, cayenne, and a couple of anchovy fillets. I add anchovy to literally all of my braised dishes, and if you've never done it I highly recommend it. It adds a little extra oomph to savory things and you will never in a million years know it's in there if you don't typically like anchovies.

-Deglaze: I finished off an almost empty bottle of white wine I had. Chicken broth would probably be what I would use if I didn't have wine. Just enough to stop any of the spices from burning. Then I added a few tablespoons of French's yellow and few tablespoons of whole mustard. You could use any mustard you prefer, I just like French's yellow because I'm a dirty American, dijon would also be delicious.

-Beans/Peas: I choose dried black eyed peas because they're traditional here and I was going for this South Carolina vibe, but any bean would be fine in something like this. Soaked them overnight, and added them after I deglazed. Then covered with water, spoonful of chicken Better Than Bullion (you could use a veggie stock if you want to keep this vegan), vinegar, and a couple of tablespoons of sugar. Stuck them in the oven at 225 and monitored them while I watched football all day. Took about 12 hours for me, but this is completely unnecessary. To speed it up just use 350 or so and check on them every fifteen minutes or so. Might take a couple of hours at that temp. I just like slow cooking when I have a free day at the house. When they feel like they're slightly overcooked, they're done. Starches harden up when cooler, so I account for that when tasting at the end for seasoning. Adjusted the seasoning at the end, and yeah now I have a lot of food.

I love this meal prep because you really have the freedom to do something nontraditional and creative. And it cost me maybe 5 bucks on that specific grocery run between the beans and the sauerkraut. Everything else were thing I had as pantry staples (yes I do keep anchovies in my fridge at all times). And I'll probably get 8-10 meals out of it. I'll cut it with white rice or frozen cauliflower rice risotto mix, depending on my self shame level that day. And not to brag, but this really hit everything I was going for. I'm already starting to think of different ways I can make this prep again. Might do an Asian thing, maybe something similar but Korean, using kimchi in some fashion. Hope this helps anyone out that might be going through a rough time. With love, from my kitchen to yours.",eatcheapandhealthy

Does anyone have any tips on streamlining pie making?

On the ingredient side I have some substitution ideas in mind

* Erythritol and sucralose to replace sugar
* If peanuts can substitute some or all of the butter, great
* I will probably start with pastry sheets or some other shortcut for the bread layer though. I get a ton of fiber from eating a lot of produce in other meals so its fine. Sugar, sat fat and oil I'm trying to cut down on

Let's talk healthy overnight oats,979,j199e2,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/j199e2/lets_talk_healthy_overnight_oats/,230,1601316175.0,"So I've been eating them for 6 months almost daily now and still love them.  

I want to share what I've learned and hopefully learn more from others.

1.  I make ""right now I'm hungry"" oats.  I do not leave them overnight. I use 5-minutes oats instead.

2. My current recipe is:

some oats

some cream of wheat

some pb2

some whey protein

some chia seeds

some hemp hearts

some cacao nibs

some granola/muesli on top

I say some because I mess with the ratios and mostly eyeball it.  It all has to fit in a single cereal bowl.

I then add: 

almond/oat/cashew/coconut milk (sometimes with unsweetened vanilla flavor)

unflavored kefir

unsweetened vanilla greek yogurt

Still untried but waiting to be tried are:

-swapping wheat germ in for the cream of wheat

-swapping in flax seeds to replace chia

3. I think variety helps keep this interesting.  So ya been doing granola then it's exciting when the muesli has raisins in it.  Whenever I'm at the store now, I'm constantly looking for something that might be new and innovative.  I personally just like to eat fruit and not add it to cereal-like dishes, so it's the other possibilities I'm focused on.  That's how cream of wheat got in there.

4.  I'm a label reader.  It's absolutely appalling how much sugar is added to supposedly healthy cereals and yogurts.  Granola is currently the sweetest thing I have in here, and it's 9 grams per serving.  Oh, and the yogurt's maybe 11g. This dish is the sweetest thing I will eat all day.    

I posted that to share, but I also posted it in hope of finding some other ingredients other people are working into theirs without raising the sugar count.

Thoughts?

UPDATE: There are some challenging how this fits the eat *cheap* part of this subreddit.

I don't have time to go shopping, so i will source prices off of amazon:

Hemp hearts $10 (my bag is still going after 6 months)

1.8 pounds of whey protein $26 (still going after 6 months)

2 pounds of PB2 $20 (still going after 6 months)

2 pounds of chia $7 (still going after six months)

8 oz cacoa nibs $10 (just replaced with larger cheaper bag)

18oz cream of wheat $4 (still going strong)


Those are the things I haven't replaced yet after 6 months of daily consumption.  That's $67 for 26 weeks of one meal a day.  26 weeks=182 days  $67/182=36 cents a day

Oatmeal probably runs one cylinder for 3 weeks.  108 oz of glysphate free oatmeal is $20 for 18 weeks of it. $20/126=16 cents a day.

Granola/muesli 160 oz of Bob's Red Mill is $28. I'm guestimating I eat 10 oz in 10 days. So 28/160=18 cents a day.

So the core grain base is 34 cents a day.

The stuff that really costs money to replenish regularly is almond milk, kefir, and yogurt.

If it's decadent to spend money on almond milk, kefir, and yogurt, then call me guilty.

But we've come this far, so let's do the math.

64oz of almond milk is $3.  I think it's longer, but let's say that lasts 10 days. 30 cents a day.

32oz of kefir is $10.  Lasts maybe 2 weeks. 71 cents a day

32oz of Oikos triple zero is a splurge that costs $6 for maybe 10 days. 60 cents.

At the high end, this costs $2.20 a day to make.  Dairy=$1.60 a day  Grains=34 cents a day Added ingredients=36 cents a day.",eatcheapandhealthy

Yesterday then I baked some cookies, to satisfy the ""normal sweet"" cravings. But they turned out horrible (As my boyfriend said,  I'm way better at cooking than baking xD ).  
That being said, do you guys have recipes for ""normal sweets"" like cookies, cupcakes, etc where I can substitute the sugar for stevia?

Yesterday I made a post asking for tips and recipes on cauliflower rice and how to make it be more rice like. I really appreciate everyone's feedback and got tones of great ideas for recipes! However I didn't find a way to make it more rice like, so I dove in deep into the world of google and found a couple tricks that I tested for lunch today. And it completely changed how it turned out! It was so much more tasty and satisfying and way less soggy! So I thought I'd share this newfound knowledge with you guys. 

Now I originally followed the instructions on the package that stated to boiled it in water, drain, fry it, and season to taste. This did NOT turn out well and I was left with a bland, soggy heap of steamed cauliflower.

Anyway, after me and Google had a little research party I found a couple of sources saying that you should squeeze the excess moisture out of the cauliflower rice( like you would shredded potatoes before making hash browns) because they hold a lot of moisture. So I gave this a try. After, I lightly coated it in olive oil and added herbs and garlic. Spread it thinly over a baking tray, and roasted it at 400 degrees fahrenheit for 10-15 minutes until it was slightly golden in color. It was sooo good! I topped it with some baked salmon, toasted pecans, butternut squash, and fresh squeezed lemon! I'm sure it would also work well if you sauteed it instead wich is what I plan to test tommorow.",eatcheapandhealthy

I realize that maybe the most quintessential healthy protein for a meal is boneless skinless chicken breasts. Oftentimes though I get dry leathery chicken, or chicken with a pale and bland exterior. As such, I thought I try my hand at making a chicken breast that stays moist, but has that golden brown delicious exterior. Below is a recipe of me making it:

[https://youtu.be/OOm1ZcW8JTg](https://youtu.be/OOm1ZcW8JTg)

Ingredients:

* 1 Quart Water
* 2 - 4 Tbsp Salt
* 2 Chicken Breasts
* Mayo (Optional)
* Pepper, to taste (Optional)
* Oil

Tools:

* Pot
* Knife
* Cutting Board
* Paper Towels
* Spatula
* Frying Pan

Chicken Breast in my area usually goes for $2.49 - $2.99/lb. So it's not the cheapest, but by no means extravagantly expensive. Especially given how lean and versatile it is. The key is to cut the breast in half to ensure even cooking and to dry the surface of it before cooking. The drier it is, the better crust you'll develop on the exterior.

**prep** 30 mins

**cook** 2 hours, 30 mins

**total** 2 hours, 60 mins

### Ingredients

#### For the meat

* 2 lbs lamb shoulder, deboned and cubed into 1-2 inch squares
* 2 tsp salt
* 2 tsp white pepper
* 2 onions, peeled and quartered
* 3 bay leaves
* 2 cinnamon sticks
* 1 tsp cardamom pods
* ½ tsp cloves
* 6 cloves garlic cloves, crushed

#### For the yogurt soup

* 2 oz pine nuts
* 4 cups full-fat yogurt (room temp)
* 1 egg
* 2 tbsp cornflour
* 4 garlic cloves, crushed
* 1/2 tsp salt
* 1 tsp black pepper
* Dried mint
* ¾ cup dried chickpeas

#### Side dish of rice

* 3 tbsp butter
* 2 tbsp olive oil
* 6 oz vermicelli
* 13 oz short-grain white rice, rinsed
* 1 ¾ cups water

### Instructions

#### Step 1: General preparation

* Have all your ingredients weighed out and ready to go. 
* Bring you yogurt to room temperature.
* If you have bought dried chickpeas for your shakriyah, remember to soak them overnight. 
* Then prepare them by covering them with a few inches of water in a suitably large pot and boiling them for two hours or until they are tender but not so soft as to be falling apart.
* Also, rinse your rice before you start, giving it a good rub under running water to wash away all the excess starch.

#### Step 2: Prepare the lamb

* Cut the lamb into 1-2 inch cubes and season with salt and pepper.
* Heat up some oil in a pan and sear the meat until it browns on both sides.
* Add the chunks of onion and sweat them on a lower heat until they start to caramelize.
* Add the bay leaves, cinnamon sticks, cardamom pods, cloves, and garlic and let them roast until they become aromatic and fill your kitchen with their smells.
* Add water to about halfway up the height of the meat chunks. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat to low, cover and simmer for about 2-2 ½ hours or until the lamb is tender.
* Keep skimming the top of the water using a spoon to leave a clear broth for the end, and keep an eye on the water level, in case you need to add some more.
* Once the lamb is ready, remove the cubes from the pot and keep them warm. 
* Pour the cooking liquid through a sieve and discard all of the chunky bits.
* Set the strained broth aside.

#### Step 3: Prepare the rice

* Heat up some butter and olive oil in a pan
* Add the vermicelli and stir well. 
* Fry them until they are golden brown, which will make them nice and crispy.
* Add the rice and stir in well with the vermicelli, making sure to coat the rice well with the oil that's in the pan
* Add the water to the rice and bring to the boil.
* Let it keep boiling until the liquid level comes down to that of the rice in the pot.
* Now turn the heat down to the lowest setting, cover and leave for 17 minutes - no peeking!
* Then turn the heat off and keep the lid on for another 15 minutes to let all the steam in the pot get absorbed by the rice.

#### Step 4: Prepare the soup

* To roast the pine nuts, heat up a pan on a medium heat then add the nuts, monitoring them very carefully and keeping them moving.
* Once you see them start to turn golden, and you can smell that delicious roasting aroma, it's time to take them off. Set them aside. 
* In a large pot, whisk the yogurt with the egg, corn flour, salt and pepper, crushed garlic and 250ml of the strained cooking liquid. 
* Add more liquid if you'd like your yogurt to be more soupy. 
* Turn on the heat and, stirring constantly to prevent coagulation, cook the yoghurt over a low heat until it comes to a simmer.
* Cook it for another 2 minutes once it boils, then turn off the heat.
* Stir in the chickpeas.

#### Step 5: Serve the shakriya

* Place the lamb chunks into a deep bowl.
* Pour over with the hot yogurt soup.
* Sprinkle with pine nuts and dried mint.
* Finally, finish with some fresh black pepper.

Easy chicken sausage from scratch,11,iz1x2c,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/iz1x2c/easy_chicken_sausage_from_scratch/,3,1600998196.0,"Hey folks,  just wanted to share a recipe I've been using here lately to turn chicken breast into loose chicken sausage.  Albertson's has been pretty steadily having chicken breast on sale about once a month, we load up on about 10-12 lbs of the stuff per run.

Credit where it's due, this is adapted from a sausage recipe from Cooking Up a Story, originally for Chicken Thighs.

2 pounds of chicken breast meat with some fat still attached

1 Tbsp  salt

1 Tbsp  fennel seeds

1 Tbsp  garlic

1.5 Tbsp olive oil

1 tsp black pepper

1.5 tsp cayenne

1 tsp lemon juice

&#x200B;

Process is straightforward.  Send the chicken through a grinder (if you don't have a grinder, you can indeed use a nice sharp knife to mince the chicken as finely as you are able, the results just won't be quite as good as with a grinder).  Toss in all the other ingredients, run it through the grinder a second time, and then let the finished product sit in the fridge for at least an hour or two.

&#x200B;

I usually cook it up in a pan as a loose sausage, and then throw it in with pasta or a pizza topping.  Nothing to stop you from tubing it up though.

&#x200B;

Some extra credit, too:  I usually thaw my chicken in the fridge, and then stick it in the freeze for around 15-30 mins before working with it, as the grinder tends to want to warm stuff up as it works with it, prematurely rending out fat.  You can send some ice cubes down the grinder after the meat, it'll help get some of the extra ground chicken out of the mechanism, and the little extra moisture in the mix helps a bit.  Finally, you can dry roast the fennel seeds and/or crush them before incorporating them to unlock some extra fragrance.  Enjoy!

&#x200B;

Edit: Just to follow up, at 1.5 tsp cayenne, this will fall into the ""spicy"" category for some people.  If you're not into that, I'd cut it back to 0.5 to 1 tsp.  My gf doesn't dig spicy foods, but at 1 tsp cayenne, she doesn't mind it.",eatcheapandhealthy

* Preheat oven to 400ºF. Pat the monkfish dry and season all over with salt. Set aside on a paper towel lined plate for 15-20 minutes. If your kitchen is quite warm, transfer the monkfish to the fridge, uncovered.

#### Prepare the Coconut-Pumpkin Puree:

* In a small pot, heat 2 teaspoons avocado oil over medium heat. Add the onion and cook, stirring often, for 5-7 minutes until softened. Add the garlic and cook an additional 2 minutes until fragrant.
* Add the canned pumpkin puree and stir to incorporate. Add a few tablespoons of water and stir. Reduce heat and simmer for 15 minutes. Season with salt and the white pepper.

#### Finish the Coconut-Pumpkin Puree:

* Add the coconut milk to the pot and bring to a low boil. Reduce heat and simmer again for 15 minutes. Using an immersion blender, blend until very smooth and creamy. Taste and season again with salt. Add another sprinkle of white pepper, if desired. Keep warm.

#### Roast the Monkfish:

* Before roasting, pat the monkfish dry once more. Season again with salt and pepper. Transfer to a lined – either foil or parchment paper – sheet pan. Pour the butter over the fish.
* Transfer the monkfish to the oven for 15-20 minutes until firm and opaque. If desired, broil for 2-3 minutes.

#### To Serve:

* Spoon the pumpkin puree onto plates and use the back of a spoon to smooth it into a circle. Sprinkle crispy onions across the center of the puree and place a monkfish filet on top. Drizzle with mustard oil, chili oil, and another sprinkle of salt. Sprinkle a few crispy onions on top of the fish and finish with a sprinkle of Aleppo flakes. Enjoy!

It's pumpkin season! Here are some favorite jack o'lantern pumpkin recipes.,13,iymo3w,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/iymo3w/its_pumpkin_season_here_are_some_favorite_jack/,1,1600937083.0,"My local grocery store just brought out their first pumpkins, and I'm so excited. For $2.97 I can get 15lbs of delicious squash, and it's so very versatile. It breaks my heart every year that so many get carved with faces and then thrown out, when there are many better and tastier ways to use them. Will a jack o'lantern pumpkin be the most flavorful squash you'll ever eat? Probably not. But bang for buck they're really hard to beat. A few of my favorite easy ways to eat a pumpkin are stew, soup, and roasted. 

&#x200B;

**Slow cooker chicken, pumpkin, and thyme with quinoa.**

Two chicken breasts

One onion, diced

Half a pumpkin, peeled and cubed

Two carrots, chopped

A few tomatoes, chopped

Half a cup of quinoa

One bay leaf

1 1/2 tsp ground thyme (or to taste)

Salt and pepper to taste

Vegetable stock to cover

&#x200B;

Layer the vegetables, quinoa, and spices on top of the chicken in the slow cooker, cover with stock by half an inch (the quinoa will absorb a lot). Cook on high for 4 hours, or according to your device. You know your quirky machine better than I do. Shred the chicken with two forks, stir, and devour. May try making a spicy chili verde version this year...

&#x200B;

**Cream of beta-carotene soup**

One red onion, chopped

Two cloves of garlic, minced

1"" ginger, minced

3-4 carrots, chopped

1/2 c. red lentils

1/2 a small to medium pumpkin, either roasted at 450 until tender or peeled and cubed.

2 tsp cumin

1 tsp ground turmeric

chili powder to taste

salt and pepper

Vegetable stock to cover

&#x200B;

Sauté the onions, garlic, and ginger until fragrant. Toss in the rest of the ingredients, simmer until tender. Use an immersion blender to puree the soup. I like this with a swirl of plain yogurt.

&#x200B;

**Honey Spiced Pumpkin**

Peel (with a vegetable peeler) a pumpkin, make sure to get through the skin. It may take two or three passes. Cut into 1"" cubes. Toss the cubes in a few tablespoons of honey or maple syrup, a few teaspoons of garam masala, and vegetable oil. Spread on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, sprinkle with salt, and roast until tender at 400 degrees, about half an hour. Brought this to thanksgiving, it was a big hit.",eatcheapandhealthy

1 sweet onion

1 Tbsp olive oil

This is my new go to lunch.  It's super cheap and my whole family loves it.  You can mess around with it a lot,  which is my favorite kind of dish. 

Ingredients: onion,  potato,  peas, ghee or butter (oil if you have neither)

Spices: salt,  use what you like but I used about equal parts coriander (that i ground right before adding), cumin, cardamom, ginger, garlic powder  and dry cilantro and a smaller amount of chili powder, ground mustard.


(Optional: bit of sesame oil and vinegar to deglaze)


1.First mix all the spices together in a small bowl.


2. Dice about 1/4 of the onion.  Dice the potato into small peices as well.  Drain and rinse the peas if using canned.  If fresh or frozen prepare appropriately.


3. Put a bit of butter on medium heat. When it melts add the onion,  a sprinkle of garlic powder and salt.  Let it cook for a bit,  you may need to turn the heat down.  Then add the potatoes and part of the spice mix and some salt. Add a bit more butter. Cook over medium or medium high until the potatoes are soft enough to your liking. (If some burn stuck bits are on the pan, mix just a bit of sesame oil and vinegar with about 1/2 water and deglaze the pan. Cook the potatoes until the water is gone.  Don't use too much liquid for this step or you'll get mashes potatoes and soggy peas) 


4. Add the peas on medium high heat.  Add the rest of the spice (and some salt and more butter if you want).  Make sure to cook the dish until the peas lose some liquid but don't let them overcook and split and become squishy.  


That's it.  It's simple but delicious,  I promise.  Kid approved as well. You can change it as you like,  add and take away ingredients.

What are some simple ways I can flavour lentils while using only 3 ingredients or less?,14,ix9okl,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/ix9okl/what_are_some_simple_ways_i_can_flavour_lentils/,22,1600752127.0,"I'n experimenting with ways I can flavour lentils with as little ingredients as possible, while still having the lentils taste good enough to stand on it's own. Maybe a little fresh salad with no dressing on the side for crunch. I'm just a super fan of lentils. For a few months I ate almost nothing but red lentils cooked with chicken broth and topped with Frank's red hot sauce. After I got sick of that, I began trying new flavors. You can make some pretty unique and tasty lentils with different spices, but sometimes it takes 5 or more. I would like to keep it to lentils and 3 other ingredients or under.

I just tried frying bacon and then cooking red lentils on top of that. Turned out delicious. Water, lentils, bacon, salt. And it tasted scrumptious.

I was thinking about making lentils with just a can of salsa thrown in, or maybe some sort of chilli paste?

I’ve been trying to lose weight for ages, always going on and off and just being really lazy about it but I’d love to give it a real go now.

My current “healthy” diet consists of an intermittent fast, eating my first meal at 12:00pm, which is almost always yoghurt with fresh fruit, chia seeds, walnuts and a small drizzle of natural peanut butter.

I then don’t really eat much, maybe a protein bar or two. Then after my run or workout for the day, a protein shake with whey, berries and almond milk.

Then I don’t eat anything else till dinner, which is normally some type of protein and veggies or a salad.

I’ve always been told that eating less calories is going to help, and I’m not getting hungry but I’m just wondering if my current diet is healthy and will help with weight loss. Currently weighing around 110kgs, 186cm, ideally would like to get to 85-90kgs.

It's winter squash season!,21,iwyz0d,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/iwyz0d/its_winter_squash_season/,8,1600718225.0,"Being the fall season, squashes are cheap and abundant. I love all varieties of squash including kabocha, spaghetti, butternut, and acorn. 

On it's own, my favourite is kabocha squash.  

I love eating both acorn and kabocha squash in ""potato wedge"" form.

To prepare:

* cut the squash and half and scoop out the innards. The skin is edible, so no need to peel.
* cut the squash into potato wedge sized pieces
* toss the pieces with olive oil and spices. I usually do garlic powder, salt and pepper, but spices like curry powder, cumin and nutmeg also work well (but not all together!)
* bake in a 400 degree oven for 60-75 minutes, flipping over halfway through.

For meal prep, the spaghetti squash is my go-to:

On Sunday, I'll cook a spaghetti squash by cutting it in half lengthwise, scooping out the inner seeds, placing the two halves on a baking sheet cut side up, then baking at 375 for 30 minutes. After removing it from the oven, I'll let it cool then use a fork to ""pull"" out the strands from the skin. At this point, the squash strands are a little undercooked, but that's good since they'll cook more on reheating.

Depending on the size of the squash, I usually get around 1.5kg of cooked squash which I find perfect for four meals. I save the squash in a container in the fridge and then each day I dish a portion into a container to bring to work along with mix-ins, sauces or spices. Some of my favourite combos include:

\- cottage cheese and Cajun spices

\- peas and ranch dressing

\- marinara sauce

\- salsa and taco spices

Spaghetti squash is so mild that it goes with nearly any flavour profile and a 360g portion is only 100 calories including 4g protein and 4g fiber. A winner for me!

I might recommend making it according to recipe one time, and then doing cauliflower next.

I serve with whole wheat pasta (feel free to add peas or broccoli if that’s your style).   And I serve leftovers on top of homemade, baked tortilla chips (just cut up corn tortillas and bake, no oil needed)

You can also make full fledged nachos with refined beans.  Or it makes a great queso if you mix in salsa!

I've just had to accept that I despise cooking - but when I try to multitask by listening to a podcast or something I end up screwing up the recipe, burning things, or more recently cutting the tip off my thumb...

So I find myself resorting to some old classics:-

* Chicken breast in curry sauce with instant rice: 20 dollars and 30 minutes of preparation for 3 substantial healthy meals - I eat a lot so the average person could probably get 4 or 5 meals out of it.
* Tuna, pasta and some light mayonaise with dill is another staple - taking about 5-10 minutes.
* Tuna and instance rice is even more ridiculous - taking about 1-2 minutes and yet being somewhat tasty and fairly healthy. However I've eaten so much mercury that thermometers should be worried about their job security.

Breakfast stuff:

- Peanut butter

- Whole wheat bread

- Bananas and apples (but I lean towards bananas because they're cheaper)

Lunch and dinner:

- Rice

- Lentils

- Mixed frozen vegetables (the only not expensive mixed frozen veggies for me are mixes of peas, carrots, and corn. I sometimes separately buy just frozen broccoli as well and use it sparingly since it's more expensive. I choose broccoli because it seems nutritionally the most efficient but that could be wrong)

Extra: 

- Vitamin C pills, needed because the diet otherwise lacks vitC (compared to buying a regular supply of any citrus fruit, buying some these supplements every once in while is cheaper, I think. The more bulk it is the cheaper, though apparently they will start to lose effectiveness after 2 years so timing accordingly is needed)

If you're craving something insanely decadent, macro (310-340cal depending on your ingredients) and budget friendly, whilst also being satiating due to its high (28g!) protein content, this might be for you!

&#x200B;

All costs are calculated from my Aldi (UK)/MyProtein and may vary from place to place!

**Ingredients:**

20g Chocolate Whey Protien (£0.24)

10g Coconut Flour ( Or 40g normal flour) (£0.05)

45g 0 Sugar Apple Sauce (£0.07)

50-60g egg whites (£0.06)

2g Zero Calorie Sweetener (£0.02) (Can sub with 1tsp of Demerara sugar if you don't like Sucralose/Stevia)

2g Baking Powder (£0.02)

2 Low Calorie Oreos ( £0.07)

50ml of low calorie ice cream (Grahams, Halo Top Etc) ( £0.22)

Total Cost: \~£0.75 or $0.97

**Method:**

Preheat oven to 150C.

Mix all the dry ingredients together and ensure it’s well mixed – no clumps

Mix all the wet ingredients together in a separate container.

Add the dry to the wet and mix together until you get a reasonably thick batter – you could also add chocolate chips/raisins/whatever else you fancy here if you would like (I added small caramel chunks)!

Now on a sheet with some baking paper take a dollop and spread it into cookie shape, roughly ¼ of the batter, add 1 oreo and add another ¼ dollop on top to cover the cookie. Do this with the other ½ the batter to form your second cookie.

Bake your stuffed oreo cookies for 9-11 minutes at 150C.

When they’re baked, take them out and let them cool for just 60 seconds or so, you want this to be hot so your ice cream melts.

Quenelle a few spoons of ice cream, roughly 50ml, onto one cookie with the top of the cookie facing down. If you cant quenelle it’s fine it just makes it sit nicer inside the two cookies. Go mad and just dollop that in there. Add your lid

That was OK aside from it costing 5 bucks.  I liked the concept and told myself I can assemble that for a fraction of the price.  It came in single-use plastic, which is yucky, BUT the container was soooo thin.

I'm searching for ultrathin tupperware with 4 sections.

The best I found on Amazon was on the big side and 12 bucks for a set of 4.  (Easylunchboxes if you wanna see what I'm talking about)

I wanna make a week's worth and store them in the fridge.  So, thinner than the amazon box would be ideal if it exists, and less that 12 bucks for tupperware if possible.

Was just reminded of my mom making this, and her love of prepping lunches for the week (not dinners, just lunches, lol). One of my favorites has always been her tuna pita pockets. I live on my own now, and have made an even easier version, but hers was probably cheaper. Goes like this

Ingedients:
Pita pockets  ( I love Joseph's low carb ones at Walmart, but bakeries have more substantial ones for cheaper)
Regular size can of tuna per whole pita, or serving
Italian dressing, or oil/vinegar
Seasonings (garlic!)
Here is the variation:
Either a bag of broccoli slaw for the easiest prep 
or:
Head of broccoli, 
carrots (large or baby), 
and onion



Instructions:
If going for easy prep:
Just mix can of tuna to about 2/3 cup slaw, season well with garlic, italian seasonings, and dressing or oil/ vinegar (i use red wine vinegar, apple cider would be good too). 
Stuff into halved pitas, and save leftovers for lunch tomorrow. 
More involved: 
Cut up broccoli/onions/carrots into processor sized pieces and process together, or chop finely and mix, then mix in tuna and spices/dressing. Stuff pita.

P.S. I hate leftover tuna because of the strong smell, but these flavors deepen nicely in the fridge, for an even better dish tomorrow. But don't stuff pitas beforehand, pack mixture in container, with pita and fork on the side.

Mushroom Barley Stew is my favorite autumn eat cheap and healthy meal.

Recipe here originally: [Easy Mushroom Barley Stew](http://triedtrue.us/MushroomBarley)

My version of Mushroom Barley Soup definitely became more of a stew; probably thanks to the copious amount of mushrooms that I added. What can I say, I'm a mushroom addict.

What Kind of Mushrooms to Use:

The answer is simple: ALL OF THEM. I love using a variety of mushrooms in cooking, so try this recipe out with a mixture of button, shiitake, cremini, oyster, diced trumpet mushrooms, or maitake mushrooms. If you have some really fancy foraged mushrooms, reserve those for the crispy topping. The variety of mushrooms will help lend a more complex flavor to this stew.

Author: Kylie Perrotti

### Equipment

* Large pot
* Small skillet

### Ingredients

#### Mushroom Barley Stew

* 2 teaspoons neutral oil for frying
* 2 tablespoons butter
* 1 pound mixed mushrooms sliced, diced, or torn depending on the variety
* 1 yellow onion peeled and diced
* 4 ribs celery diced
* 6 young carrots diced *(see note)*
* 6 cloves garlic peeled and minced
* 4 Roma tomatoes diced (or use 1 14.5-ounce can diced tomatoes)
* 1 cup pearl barley
* 2 tablespoons flour optional
* 6 cups mushroom or vegetable stock plus more, as needed
* 1 teaspoon dry thyme plus more to taste
* 1 teaspoon dry chives plus more to taste
* 1 teaspoon dry parsley plus more to taste
* ½ teaspoon crushed red pepper plus more, to taste
* Salt and pepper to taste

#### Crispy Mushroom Topping:

* 1 teaspoon extra virgin olive oil
* 8 ounces mushrooms torn or sliced, depending on variety
* 1/4 cup fresh parsley minced
* Flaky sea salt

### Instructions

#### Cook the Mushrooms:

* Heat oil and butter in a large heavy pot over medium-high heat. Add the mushrooms and cook for 8-12 minutes, stirring often, until well-browned and softened. Season with salt and pepper and transfer to a bowl.

#### Cook the Mirepoix:

* If the pot is too dry, add another drizzle of oil. Add the onion, carrots, and celery and cook for 5-7 minutes until just beginning to soften. Add the garlic and cook for 45 seconds.
* Add the diced Roma tomatoes and the barley and cook for 1 minute, stirring regularly. Return the mushrooms to the pot and stir.

#### Add the Stock:

* Sprinkle the flour over the dish and stir to combine. Cook, stirring often, for 2-3 minutes until the flour deepens in color. Be careful not to burn the flour.
* Pour in 1 cup of stock and whisk to combine. Continue adding the stock, one cup at a time, whisking after each addition until all the stock is added. Season with chives, thyme, and parsley. Add the crushed red pepper and season again with salt and pepper to taste.
* Bring to a boil and then reduce heat and simmer for 25-30 minutes until the barley is tender. Taste and season again to preference.

#### Fry the Mushrooms:

* Once the stew is ready to serve, crisp up the mushroom topping.
* Heat the oil in a skillet over high heat. Once very hot, add the mushrooms and cook without moving for 2-3 minutes until very well browned. Flip and cook an additional 1-2 minutes until well-browned on the other side. Turn off the heat.
* Transfer the mushrooms to a bowl with freshly minced parsley and sprinkle immediately with flaky sea salt. Toss to coat with parsley.

#### To Serve:

* Divide the mushroom barley stew between bowls and pile the crispy mushrooms on top. Garnish with any remaining parsley. Enjoy!

### Notes

I used young, small carrots which did not need to be peeled. If using larger carrots, you only need 3 carrots. Peel them first.

Ingredients: 1lb black beans, 5 cups chicken broth, 4 bay leaves, 1 bell pepper, 1 onion, 10 cloves garlic, 1/2 cup olive oil,  1 tsp cumin, 2 tsp oregano, 1 tbsp red wine vinegar

Directions:  rinse beans, then soak overnight in chicken broth, 1/2 of each of the diced pepper and onion (save rest for later), 5 diced garlic cloves, and bay leaves.

Next day, cover and boil the beans/broth mixture for 2 hours on medium low, if beans become exposed add some water, usually a cup or 2 depending on how much steam escapes.  During this time, sauté the remaining diced pepper and onion and garlic in the olive oil.  This seems like a lot of oil but trust me.

Remove the bay leaves and add the sauté mixture.  Boil for 3 hours on low, making sure the beans are not exposed.  Stir as needed.  During the 3 hours, do this twice or 3 times:  using a potato masher, mash the beans lightly 3 or 4 times and stir.  The mashed beans will soak up the excess oil from the sauté.

At the end, add the cumin and oregano, salt and pepper to taste (should not need any).  If you want it a little less broth, you can reduce at this time.

Serve over rice or just eat as a black bean soup (can top with chopped tomato, shredded cheese, etc.)",eatcheapandhealthy

* Cucumber strips
* Shredded spring onions
* A tortilla wrap or toasted cinnamon bagel (trust me, it somehow works) if you can't get hold of the traditional pancakes

And you've got a fake duck wrap. I haven't experimented with grilling the tuna with the hoisin on it, but that might give it the sticky consistency you normally get with duck.

I’m currently in a serious quarantine (as in, can’t leave my basement - a bedroom a bathroom and a laundry room) with nothing but a water kettle - no fridge, hot plate, etc. I was initially hopeful I would leave quarantine this weekend, but there’s now some signs I might need 2-3 weeks further.

For this, this makes enough for one person for a couple of days, I'd say.

You can use a fork to mix it like she used to, but if you have a food processor, your hand will thank you for it.

Ingredients:

* Garlic (1 clove)
* 1/2 of a lemon
* 1 can of chick peas (15.5 oz)
* Tahini (\~1 tbsp)
* Olive oil (\~1/3rd a cup)

Steps:

1. Chop garlic coarsely so it can get caught up in the food processor. If you're doing it by hand, mince it
2. Add tahini and garlic to the food processor
3. Juice the half of the lemon over a strainer thing directly into the food processor
4. You can pulse/run the food processor for 30 seconds or so if it's a cheap POS like mine and can't handle everything all at once
5. Drain chickpeas out of can and add directly into food processor
6. Add a good couple of TBSP of olive oil
7. Process for about a minute
8. Add some more olive oil for good measure (you want it to be nice and smooth)
9. Process again
10. If you're not happy with the taste, you can adjust with more lemon or tahini, or add a touch of  salt and process again. Honestly I rarely add salt, I think it tastes bangin' without it.

Viola! You can eat this with Syrian bread with your hands along with some mezze like my grandma and I used to or, if you're an American heathen like me, you can add it to a tortilla with some chopped up cucumbers, carrots, maybe a touch of balsamic vinegar to get yourself a nice veggie wrap. Super quick to make.

So I recently made this vegetable pulao/biryani and it was actually pretty cheap while also being very nutritious. I used soy chunks that are available here in India for quite cheap but you can use any protein of choice (but I wouldn't use chicken breast as the cooking time is a bit more and the chicken could get chewy.) I make large portions of this and just keep it in the fridge for 3-4 days and use it as sort of a meal prep.

Recipe:
-If using soy chunks, boil them in some salt water until soft. Drain the water and squeeze the chunks to remove as much water as possible. (Skip this step if using chicken).
- Marinate the soy chunks/chicken (For the recipe I am posting I'd say a pound is enough but multiply the recipe if you want to cook in bulk) in half cup yogurt, salt, chilli powder and turmeric. Let it marinate for at least half an hour.
- Now in a pot/wok take 2 tbsp of olive oil/any oil of choice. Add a tbsp of minced garlic and a tbsp of ginger paste/1inch piece of finely chopped ginger. Add in 2 chopped onions and a pinch of salt and cook until mushy. Add in 4 chopped tomatoes and cook them all until mushy and the entire thing resembles a paste. Add in any vegetables of choice, I added 3 potatoes, about 100gms of peas and 100gms of cauliflower florets. Now sautee it all for 5-10 minutes until potatoes look a bit cooked. Add in the soy chunks/chicken and let it all cook for another 10 minutes until the chicken is a bit tender. Add in a tbsp of chilli powder (less if you like it less spicy or skip it all together), half a tsp of turmeric powder and a heaping tbsp of biryani masala. Add salt to taste. Now add in 200gms of rice (any white rice is okay, I prefer basmati rice.) Add in enough water to just drown the whole thing and just let it all cook until the rice is soft and cooked and the water is all evaporated. Enjoy with a cup of cold yogurt or cucumber raita (I'll post recipe in the comments. It is also a cheap and healthy recipe).",eatcheapandhealthy

So I use the ""leftovers"" for a flavourful stock that I can freeze pretty flat in a ziplock bag. I just cut up all the veggies (onions, carrots, and celery obviously work great and I use them a lot in the kitchen but really every leftover veggie can go in there: Bell peppers give great flavour, leftover pieces of garlic, ginger you name it) in evenly sized pieces (make sure to use the stems and peels as well, it all contributes to the flavour, especially onion peel!), put them on a baking sheet and roast them in the oven til they get a good char (you could also do that in a large pot on the stove without oil but on a baking sheet in the oven you'll get more even heat distribution). It smells wonderful. Then I dump them in a large pot (the more veggies the more flavour), fill it with water, bring it to a boil for a few minutes and then let it simmer for-a-long-time. Keep an eye on it from time to time but you can easily let it simmer for 3-4 hours. Usually it will be reduced by at least 1/4. By then the stock will have a beautiful dark, rich color. I strain it, let it cool down and then freeze it. It's perfect for a quick pho-like noodle soup (add some noodles, some thinly sliced meat, green onions, chili and soy sauce), for thinning out pumpkin, lentil, pea or whateveryoulike-soups (more flavour than water!) or on cold days I just drink it as is.

You start by cooking the potatoes, and while they are cooking start cooking the onions. when the onions start to caramelize, throw in the ground beef with some salt and pepper to taste. Once the meat has browned, drain, turn off the burner and let it rest.

When the potatoes are done, drain, and mash.

Looking for a Pad Thai recipe,3,it15jc,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/it15jc/looking_for_a_pad_thai_recipe/,3,1600170700.0,"Hello! Thanks ahead of time for reading this.

I just got married and want to do something nice for my husband as a surprise once we finish updating and moving in to our new house in a few months. His favorite dish is chicken Pad Thai, which he will rave about for days. He likes the heat level at the local restaurant between Medium+ and Hot.

My problem is three-fold: 

1: I have no personal spice tolerance. Medium salsa can sometimes push past my limit, and when I sampled one of his plates years ago I basically chugged all the water at the table while holding back tears. Basically the stereotypical white girl tolerance much to my shame.

2: He has found in some restaurants that they add way too much sweetness to the dish. I don’t know if it naturally has a lot of sweetness or if he just prefers it the authentic way since I haven’t sampled most of them (see above for why) but typically that is his biggest complaint.

3: I have never made it before. And if I ever tried, to a certain degree I would not be able to taste-test it properly due to problem 1. I am a decent cook when it comes to Americana and some European fair, but I can count on one hand how many times I have made an Authentic Asian dish. So I need a recipe that is as idiot-proof and straight-forward as possible because at least for half the time I’m cooking, I will not be able to taste as I go.

I really want to do this for my husband but have no idea where to start, and I don’t want to blow through a ton of unnecessary ingredients and waste time and money on it since part of the idea is we would save money with the dinner that night and the leftovers for later. I figured this would be a good place to start, or at least someone here might be able to point me in the right direction if this isn’t who I should ask.

Does anyone have any recipes or tips for cooking Pad Thai they could share?

Thanks again!",eatcheapandhealthy

Months ago i switched from buying fast food to cooking them. Since my diet was lacking of 

vegetables, last week, i ate vegetable on most of my meals. my actions was to mix them(salad, tomato, lentil, cucumber, pepers...) and eat them with rice or pasta. There was meat and fish sometimes. Vegetable were between 50 to 100% of the meal.

&#x200B;

stuffs i have noticed on myself: 

\-eat less and rarely feel hungry

\-feelings that i have nothing to eat

\-eating to have energy and not for pleasure (even thought i 6 vegetable i love)

\-Feeling more have and proud

\-sleep is more regular 

\-feel more energy

\-more sensitive to sugar and salt

I don't know if i'm doing it right, most of the meal are different but i'm mainly mixing some vegetables and occasionnaly adding rice, pasta or tortilla.

"Any ideas on how to eat cheap, healthy, and high calorie / protein, without cutting quality of food?",2,isplgl,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/isplgl/any_ideas_on_how_to_eat_cheap_healthy_and_high/,12,1600133410.0,"I'm a relatively fit guy, and am active every day (weightlifting, walking, hiking, basketball, etc). 

I'm really trying to figure out ways to pull extra money out of my budget, in order to put towards my debt. But I'm having a hard time doing this WITHOUT cutting the quality of the food. Any helps?

I'm currently eating 3500 calories a day, and am at about 225 grams of protein. This is where I want to stay at right now.

Most of my food is organic, especially my fruits / veggies. I eat grass fed / organic beef, and pasture raised eggs / milk. Other than one scoop of protein power and some whole wheat tortillas, everything else is whole foods.

The eggs, meat, and milk are the most expensive part of my budget. I eat appx 7 lbs of beef of week, 28 eggs a week, and a gallon and a half of milk a week. This comes up to about $70 a week just for these three items. Total each week, I'm spending $133 on food, and this doesn't include spices, the random order out night, or the very limited amount of supplements I take (Vit D and fish oil, pretty much it). 

I feel like I'm just eating away whatever money I make.

So my question:

Is lowering the quality of the food, like not buying eggs from pasture raised chickens or grass fed beef, worth it? Especially since I eat so much of it? I have fears that lowering it will also lower the health value of the foods (more pesticides, hormones, more bad ingredients, less vitamins, less bioavailability, etc), but that probably just stems from ignorance.

I'm open to suggestions on other foods! But just a quick warning, I'm allergic to peanut butter, sunflower seeds, and despite trying to get ""used to"" beans / lentils for a long while, they ruin my stomach so I largely try and stay away.",eatcheapandhealthy
"Talking to my new Primary Care Physician Wednesday, but still want ideas...",5,isp6rs,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/isp6rs/talking_to_my_new_primary_care_physician/,14,1600132219.0,"First off, I have a tiny bit of an idea for what to do, I may not do this until after COVID is over, however and I may see if I can talk my husband into getting an exercise bike. I'll probably start with 20 min a day then work my way up. I've been trying to eat healthier, I do splurge at random and make things like steak maybe once every 3-6 months. Sometimes I think I'm just listening to by body and I know I need the iron, it's usually around my cycle that I crave it. I'm 5'9"" and weigh approximately 235, I want to get down to about 150. I haven't been able to be super active with COVID, I'm immunocompromized and can't really leave the house. 

I know I was at my healthiest when my husband and I were stationed in Yokosuka, Japan and I don't really know what it was that made the biggest difference, the portion sizes or what was actually in the food. When I got back to the US, everything tasted super salty to me, it took about a week to get used to. I guess best thing to do would be to talk about what I ate there as far as restaurants goes:

Tonkatsu Wako - Tonkatsu (fried pork loin), miso soup, cabbage with a soy sauce/yuzu dressing, rice, goma ae (wilted spinach salad with a soy sauce and sesame dressing), pickled daikon and matcha that you could make at the table.

Kagetsu Arashi Ramen - Well, I suppose the name says it all, but, this was a pork ramen shop that we frequented, the portions were pretty large, but all the ingredients were totally natural and the restaurant even made their own stocks and noodles. 

Sushi-ro - A conveyor belt sushi restaurant that you just grabbed a plate of whatever you wanted.

And there's the places that I don't remember the names for, mostly because I wasn't good at reading kanji, I was good at reading Hiragana and Katakana. I also loved Takoyaki, it looked like they used a really thin pancake batter to fill up a pan that had little dips in it, they would add pickled ginger, green onion and octopus, they would keep moving it around until it resembled a donut hole... then it got covered in a brown sauce, mayo, katsuobushi (dried smoked tuna that looked like wood shavings and seemed to dance in the breeze) and seaweed. Taiyaki, well... for lack of a better description, a filled waffle that was shaped like a fish. Yakitori, a stand you'd go to and just grab skewers of different cuts of chicken. I liked Kitsune Udon in the winter, that had fried tofu, and Bukkake Udon in the summer, it was cold, had grated daikon and ginger, a soft boiled egg and green onion. Another go to in summer was Zaru Soba, basically soba noodles that you dipped in a soy sauce broth. There was also a Hamburg Steak place we went to, it basically was a hamburger patty, a sunny side up egg pickled vegetables, and a steak sauce they made themselves. There were also bowls of rice I could get with eel on them.

I may need to get a book on Tsukemono, Japanese pickles, because it wasn't just the daikon that I liked.

So, I think part of what made me lose weight in Japan was that all the foods were of better quality and possibly the fact that most of the time the portion sizes were smaller and maybe that I was walking everywhere. I know also that a couple of my medications cause weight gain, so losing weight is going to be a challenge.

I know once we move, I'm probably going to really overhaul my diet, especially when my husband isn't home, when he's away on the submarine, I'll be able to make all the things he doesn't like, like fish. I make awesome salmon and I'll probably be doing that.",eatcheapandhealthy

Dairy and eggs are still both fine on ""vegetarian days"".

However, I live with my brother, and he cannot stand eggs. This comes to be a bit of a problem when I decide to make a carb-heavy meal (such as noodles with cabbage or fried rice). My family likes when I just fry up or scramble a quick egg or two with these meals to balance it out, but I don't know what to do for him. He normally likes high carb meals anyway, so I know he'd just say to leave the egg out if I asked him, but I would rather include a protein he likes with the meal so he doesn't have to give up nutrition if he doesn't have to.

He's not picky otherwise, so I don't feel bad tucking aside an extra easy protein in the fridge just for him, even if it's meat, but I'm kind of stuck at which ones to start.

I can shave a carrot into that Thai curry, or add a can of lentils into an Indian dish even if I've eaten all the chicken that originally came with it. It works best if you know what veggies tend to go in which cuisines and work off of the already existing flavor profile.

Kettle corn for the win!,47,irraq2,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/irraq2/kettle_corn_for_the_win/,8,1599998206.0,"Been making this for a salty/sweet snack for YEARS. 
I love it, my family loves it, and it’s an easy snack for company (gets requested often!). Not to mention that it’s great for people with the most common food allergies/sensitivities since it’s literally just corn/oil/salt/sugar. 

I have tweaked the steps a bit:
For best results, use a thick bottomed pan. 
1. Add 1/4 cup canola/vegetable oil to pan on high heat and drop in 5-6 kernels evenly spaced around the pot so you know when the oil is hot enough. Replace lid.
2. Wait until all test kernels have popped and then pour in 1/2 cup kernels. Sprinkle 1/4 cup sugar over them and replace lid. 
3. Wait until kernels start popping and then shake the pan back and forth until the popping slows to a couple seconds between pops
4. Pour into one XL bowl or two large bowls (spray with cooking spray so the popcorn doesn’t stick)
5. Sprinkle with table salt to taste (so less than you think you’ll need and add more as you mix if needed) and then toss to mix (think like wok mixing https://s3.amazonaws.com/finecooking.s3.tauntonclud.com/app/uploads/2017/04/18141702/fc46tr071-01-main.jpg). The tossing helps break up the chunks and helps any remaining water in the popcorn to evaporate so you get the nice crisp fair-quality kettle corn. Stirring with a spoon may also work. :)

Today I’m going to show you how to make the Japanese Yaki Gyoza. It’s quite easy but I added water too much this time, so it gets soft a little. It was supposed to be more crispy outside, maybe I retry it someday…  

Anyway, Gyoza is potstickers, and usually refers to Yaki-Gyoza, pan-fried Gyoza, in Japan. It’s a very popular dish in Japan but it derives from the Chinese dish. Do you know that? Japanese people made a change to adopt Japanese taste. Hope you enjoy this video. Please give it a try.

Ingredients

* Gyoza skin, 20 pieces
* Minced pork, 150g
* Minced cabbage, 220g
* Chopped Chinese chive, 50g 
* Grated ginger
* Soy sauce, 1tbsp
* Sesame oil, sugar, sake, and potato starch, 1tsp each
* Salt and pepper, a little (if you like)
* Water

Steps

* Mince cabbage and chop Chinese chive.
* Knead minced pork and add the vegetable.
* Knead it well and add salt, pepper, soy sauce, sesame oil, sugar, sake, potato starch as well as grated garlic and ginger.
* Wrap the filling into Gyoza skin each.
* Heat a pan and cook gyoza until its surface gets brown.

What is your favorite way to prepare tofu before adding it to a dish?,133,irbpuw,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/irbpuw/what_is_your_favorite_way_to_prepare_tofu_before/,71,1599942563.0,"My wife and I are pretty new to tofu but due to our money situation it has become a pillar of our diet. So far the best way we have found to prepare it is to freeze it, thaw it, squeeze out all the water we can, cut it into smaller cubes, and then bake the cubes for 30 minutes flipping them halfway through. This process makes the tofu crispy and gets rid of the tofu flavor. Also, it might be my imagination, but I think the tofu soaks up sauce like a sponge when prepared this way and added to a saucy dish. Do you guys prepare yours any other way?

"So i have decided to do a food audit in my journey to eat cheap and healthy, but i think it would be best first to explain my circumstances.",3,ira4l5,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/ira4l5/so_i_have_decided_to_do_a_food_audit_in_my/,16,1599934718.0,"hello, i wanted to make this post in my journey to eating cheap and healthy and to explain my circumstances and why i think doing a food audit might be a good idea for me, and if it is, i want to find out what the best way to do a food audit would be. 

before i begin, i want to define what a food audit is, a food audit is where you go through your fridge, pantry, freezer, and write down everything that you have, what you have, how much, expiration dates, and sale dates, and overall getting a list of all the food that you have.

now for the circumstances: i have recently moved into a new house with several room mates, and i found that we have a full kitchen and all the cup boards and pantry seem to be filled with a huge amount of canned foods, rice and beans. 

upon further investigation, i found that a resident in the house is a thief, or a residents friend is a thief but a lazy thief, as they only seem to steal whatever is premade and ready to eat, (chocolate milk, gogurt, microwave burrito's ect.) and who ever the thief is, they leave base ingredients alone, rice, beans and spices are all virtually untouched. 

i asked where all this food came from and the only answer is got is that previous residents have moved in, then go to food banks and get rice, beans, and canned food, and then never cook the rice, beans and canned food, and when they move out, they don't bother to take it with them. 

so i am in a unique circumstance where there is a huge amount of abandoned community food at my house, somewhere to the tune of 20 pounds of beans, rice, and other canned foods, alone with a spice shelf that is overflowing with spices, and given these circumstances, i think performing a food audit, to find out in total what the house has, would be a good idea. 

now that i have explained the circumstances i find myself in, i want to say that i have never cooked, i am not a good cook, and i have never been a good cook, but i find myself in a circumstance where it would be very, very useful to learn how to cook, and so i think the first step in doing that would be to do a food audit.

for those of you who have done a food audit, what is the best way to do it? i am thinking of doing it with a spread sheet but i wanted to ask what you guys thought, thanks.",eatcheapandhealthy

As you can tell by the ingredients, there's a lot of room to improvise and substitute 

- one box penne pasta 
- two boneless skinless chicken breasts 
- half of one onion
- minced garlic
- olive oil
- dried rosemary 
- garlic salt, salt, pepper
- can of chicken broth (or chicken bullion) 
- whipping cream (or whole milk)
- parmesan (optional)
- water

Start by cooking your chicken in a large sauce pan with a little olive oil, season with salt, pepper, garlic salt, and a little bit of rosemary. Cook about 80% of the way done and set aside. 

Deglaze the pan with whatever alcohol you have lying around, vodka, whiskey, wine, etc. Roughly chop your onion and mince your garlic (unless you're like me and just buy it prepackaged) Throw that in the pan and cook until a little translucent, adding a small amount of olive oil as you go to prevent burning. Throw in rosemary to taste (I usually use about two to three pinches of dried)

Now, pour in the box of penne and add the can of chicken broth, plus an additional can of water or two. Make sure to have enough liquid to cover the top of the noodles. Bring to a boil and let simmer, stirring occasionally.

During that time, chop up the chicken to bite sized pieces and add to the pot to let it finish cooking. Season everything to taste, I usually add some lemon juice, salt, pepper, and garlic salt and any more additional rosemary. 

Let the liquid simmer down until there's about 1/2 inch left and then add a splash of whipping cream or whole milk to make it creamy. Stir to incorporate, and add parmesan cheese if desired. Let all the liquid simmer until just gone, and that's it!

It's a simple cold beet soup, and fabulously pink: https://imgur.com/QsoOE20

This recipie is easy to adjust to taste, so I've included ingredient ranges rather than specifics.  Start with the minimum of eash, and add according to your taste:

* 250-350 grams red beet, cooked (while you can make this with canned beet, most grocery stores now sell pre-cooked beets which taste far better.  You can also boil or roast beets yourself, of course)

* 4-5 hardboiled eggs

* a long cucumber

* fresh dill (10-15 grams ought to do)

* 1-1.5 litre buttermilk

Steps:

1) grate beets using a cheese grater (use the largest shredding)

2) slice hardboiled eggs, then sliver the slices so it's similar in size to the beet

3) chop at least 3/4 of the cucumber into very thin slices, then quarter the slices

4) chop the dill finely

5) add all the above ingredients into a very large pot or bowl, add buttermilk, add salt to taste, and stir.  The soup should turn rather pink.

6) serve cold either on its own, or with a thick slice of sourdough bread or boiled potatoes.

I would have never thought of adding orange peel and fresh orange juice to beef soup, but the bright citrus proved to be a formidable ingredient in this soup recipe!

## Note: Oil, Salt, and Pepper are not included in ingredient count.

## Substitutions:

* Ground Beef: Use ground turkey, ground chicken, or more cannellini beans for a vegan option.
* Red Bell Pepper: Carrot, celery, or diced sweet potato
* Orange: Lemon, but flavor will be a little different
* Cannellini Beans: Any white bean such as navy, great northern, chickpea, etc.

Calories: 400kcal

Author: Kylie Perrotti

## Equipment

* Soup pot

## Ingredients

* 1 pound ground beef
* 1 tablespoon neutral oil
* 1 medium yellow onion
* 1 red bell pepper
* 5 cups water (or low-sodium chicken stock)
* 1 navel orange
* 1 15-ounce can cannellini beans
* 1 bunch Lacinato kale
* ½ cup fresh parsley
* 1 teaspoon dry thyme
* 1 teaspoon dry chives
* Crushed red pepper to taste
* Salt and pepper to taste
* Drizzle of extra virgin olive oil optional, for garnish

## Instructions

## Prepare Ingredients:

* Peel and dice the onion. Trim and deseed the bell peppers and then dice. Using a vegetable peeler, peel off 4 strips of orange peel and set aside. Juice the orange into a bowl. Drain and rinse the beans. Roughly chop the kale. Roughly chop the fresh parsley and tender stems.

## Brown the Beef:

* Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a soup pot over medium high until very hot. Add the ground beef and cook for 5 minutes until well browned all over, breaking the beef up with a wooden spoon as it cooks. Season with salt and pepper. Transfer to a bowl and drain off all but 1 tablespoon oil from the pot. \*Note: beef does not need to be completely cooked through!

## Prepare the Vegetables:

* Add the diced onion and diced peppers in the pot over medium high. Cook, stirring regularly, until softened and beginning to brown all over, about 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.

## Prepare the Soup:

* Pour in 5 cups water or chicken stock and add the orange peel and orange juice. Scrape up any browned bits stuck to the bottom. Bring to a boil. And reduce heat and simmer.
* Next, add cooked beef and the rinsed cannellini beans. Season with dry thyme, dry chives, and a sprinkle of crushed red pepper. Season with salt and pepper. Cook for 10-15 minutes to allow the flavors to meld.
* Add chopped kale and roughly chopped fresh parsley and cook until wilted but bright green, about 3-5 minutes. Turn off heat.

## To Serve:

* Discard orange peels. Ladle the beef soup into bowls and drizzle with extra virgin olive oil and add a sprinkle of crushed red pepper if desired. Enjoy!

Lockdown has been hard and has forced most people to stay inside like myself. I'm not much of a cook but staying inside meant cooking a lot more and that was something I was unsure of. I didn't want to end up eating unhealthy things everyday and eating frozen food was not an option. I had to get all my pantry and fridge stocked up and remember what was what as a beginner. Eating healthy was going to be a challenge because I, like many of you, am a junk food binge eater. My journey to eating healthy and learning along the way was long but all that effort was worth it. I realised I felt better about myself and also the fact that I made it myself made me appreciate it even more !
Luckily I found an app ( it's called KitchenPal on the app store)  on my phone that really helped me manage and organize the whole kitchen process. It helped me keep a grocery shopping list for when i went to shop so that i don't forget when i'm actually there and besides that i found out it had recipes on it as well and if you put in all the ingredients you do have, it shows recipes WITH those ingredients ! i was actually impressed with that because it gave me a lot of control over organizing and stocking up the kitchen. The most important part is that it helped me reduce food waste to a large extent and I would totally recommend everyone to get it if these are some of the things you are looking for.(thought it might help others as much as it helped me) Anyways, I tried to make something new everyday and honestly I was fairly impressed. I think now I'm gonna cook more myself and depend less on take away and ordering all the time. I dont think I'm an expert now but I'm getting there ! Now onto the more difficult dishes haha ! I realise I’m saving a lot of money when I’m making my own food and also eating healthier, which is something I’ve been procrastinating for a long time.

- 1/2 onion (red preferred), thinly sliced ($0.33)
- 1 1/2 Tbsp olive oil + more for drizzle ($.20)

- feta/goat cheese (or any other soft cheese) ($2+)

- 1-2 hot peppers (I used serrano) chopped ($.50)
- oregano
- any other vegetable you might want to add (cucumber, bell pepper, etc)

Toss it all (minus cheese) in a baking pan to combine, sprinkle cheese on top, drizzle with extra oil and seasoning, cover with foil. Bake at 425 for 30 min, uncover and bake/broil for another 3-5 min or until cheese is browning.

What I want is ideas for healthy breakfast options. What I like is VARIETY. I usually buy a lot of stuff and eat sth different each day for breakfast. I do not have any allergies other than soy which block completely my metabolism, and animal milk which cause me to experience other kind of stuff... I do use plant based milk though (almond or rice). If you could also suggest some snacks to eat throughout the day, because I do have cravings would be also perfect 👌 
I am 70 kg ( I hope) now, and I want to be 65kg and after that to keep it that way. I am up for any suggestion and convo. Thank you",eatcheapandhealthy

"Morning Mixup: Rice, eggs, jerk onions, +",42,ipgkq6,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/ipgkq6/morning_mixup_rice_eggs_jerk_onions/,1,1599689409.0,"I don't know what to call this recipe other than a morning mixup. I'd call it a mashup but there's no mashed potatoes.

Anyways, if you have ample time in the morning, on a weekend for example, or if you want to prep a delicious morning meal for the week then give this a try. I eyeball everything admittedly, but I've only been playing around with this recipe for about a week and these are the ratios I like. I'm a 6'3"" 190lb male so this might be 2-3 servings for some of you though. Makes for a nutritious, delicious, and relatively cheap breakfast:

- Put one cup of rice on to boil (add a pinch of salt).
- Slice one large yellow onion into 1inchx1inch squares.
- When the rice is about halfway done, get out two small pans and cook 2-3 eggs Sunnyside up in one pan (or easy over, whatever way you'd prefer that will keep the yolk runny). I just ate this with 3 eggs and it was scrumptious.
- While cooking the eggs, caramelize the sliced onion in the other pan with approx 1 tablespoon to 1 & 1/2 tablespoons of jerk seasoning on low to medium heat, or make your own jerk with allspice (i.e. cinnamon, nutmeg, clove), brown sugar, garlic, thyme, and salt. I use a sweet jerk (relatively speaking), but a spicier jerk might do just as well.
- When the oniona and eggs are done mix em all together with the rice. Add ghee or butter to melt over the mix for some extra flavour.
- Depending on how I'm feeling I add about a teaspoon to a tablespoon of dill, and a teaspoon of minced garlic.
- Add a handful of baby spinach.
- Finish it all off with about a handful of peanuts. Crush em up if you'd like but I'm typically too lazy.

If prepping for the week then adjust the ratios proportionately based on desired number of servings, but I'd err on the lower side for the spices since they can be pretty strong. This takes me about 30 minutes to cook, and that's mostly waiting on the rice to cook.

That's the core recipe, then you can add carrots in with the onions and soften them up together. Sometimes I'll add cubed avocado and chia seeds, but you can add whatever floats your boat really so go nuts! I put cucumbers and sunflower seeds in once and it was great, and even used some staghorn sumac in it that I'd foraged from around the area. (The tang from the sumac was a good addition, I imagine a small amount of lemon juice would go great with this too but I haven't experimented with that yet)

I imagine this would go really well in a burrito too.

Try it out and let me know if you enjoyed it :) would also love to hear about your own experiments!!",eatcheapandhealthy

Since we have an electric oven (one of those you can put two 6 by 8 trays in on top of each other) as part of our electric stove, I was thinking if it would be better if she just do the toasting in the oven.

Thing is before when she had the toaster, she would put in like 2 slices of bread at a time, and perhaps make 3 batches in the morning.

Still I don't think she's going to use that oven toaster everyday.

So I was wondering if using that electric oven to toast 6 slices of bread at a time in the electric oven for maybe like 1 to 3 times a week, or maybe let's say everyday, is just ok compared to getting a small oven toaster. I'm concerned with how hot the oven gets though, I feel like it's wasted energy. I live in a tropical country lol.

Hence, for college I made it a goal to streamline my eating + shopping schedule to be as convenient as possible.

Going off on a small tangent - one of the biggest mistakes people make when trying to eat healthy for the first time is being way too restrictive. The stereotypical chicken + rice + broccoli recipe is hell for most people, thus unsustainable, and they end up giving up.

But that's exactly what I'm doing. I go for chicken thighs (cheaper than breasts + wayyyy tastier, slightly higher fat and slightly lower protein content) + rice + either spinach or broccoli and chuck em all in a rice cooker. Add some spices, press the button, and wait. When it's done I'll crack an egg or several in and let them cook. Then when I take it out, I'll add some soy sauce, maybe some sesame seeds, maybe some roasted seaweed. Oh and douse it in hot sauce usually. This is my go-to dinner when I have no other plans. Every day I've tried something new, and I actually get excited to eat it every day. The simplicity of the base recipe (rice, chicken, veggie of choice) makes it extremely versatile to adding things like spices and sauces, etc. I've fried it up before too. And most of all it's delicious and I love it, which is the most important thing since it means I can sustain it. And with a bonus that it's healthy and high in protein.

I say I perfected it for myself because it checks all my boxes:

* cheap
* simple ingredients
* easy to make
* versatile/customizable (so I don't get bored)
* healthy/high protein
* delicious (in my opinion)",eatcheapandhealthy

According to google there is already such thing as white bean and tuna salad, but if you pare it down to only the bare-bones, most necessary ingredients, in this house it becomes tunabeans.   

I’ll admit that tunabeans isn’t the prettiest bowl of food in the world, but it is tastier than it has a right to be and is lightweight for when the humidity and heat gets you down.

Ingredients 
- 1 can tuna (5 oz) 
- 1 can Cannelini beans (15.5 oz)
- some Olive oil 
- some lemon juice 
- black pepper (optional) 

Steps 
- drain tuna, drain beans, mix in a large bowl. 
- drizzle some olive oil over the top and mix.
- drizzle some (or a lot, you do you) of lemon juice over the top and mix. 
- taste it, add black pepper if you want to. (I usually don’t.) 


The recipe feeds 2 of us if we pair it with a side, and it costs about $2 usd if you already have olive oil and lemon juice.  I have a hypothesis that it would also taste good with some chopped peppers or some hot sauce, but have yet to experiment with those.",eatcheapandhealthy

Some other ideas:

* Brown/green lentils + spaghetti sauce make a great bolognese. Add sauteed mushrooms if you have them.
* Brown/green lentils make great taco filling!
* Shepherd's pie, but make it lentils (and extra chunky veggies)
* Red lentils make a nice dal especially with some tomatoes and a squeeze of lemon to finish
* Add red lentils to butternut squash or pumpkin soup
* Fancy french/puy lentils or black lentils are my favorite for cold salads since they hold their shape the best when cooked. Try a mustard vinaigrette and top with a poached egg.",eatcheapandhealthy

A quick guide to freekeh: an incredibly versatile grain,22,ip03co,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/ip03co/a_quick_guide_to_freekeh_an_incredibly_versatile/,4,1599621459.0,"Hey ECAH! I'm here to tell you about this virtually unknown middle-eastern food that's actually really amazing! Freekeh is essentially green wheat (i.e. harvested when it is still quite young) that has been roasted/smoked by being set on fire. It can avoid burning due to its high moisture content, and the resulting flavour is complex, nutty, smoky, and absolutely delicious. [Here's what it looks like](https://msmarket.coop/wp-content/uploads/freekeh-e1462809833108.jpeg).

It's also extremely healthy, even compared to similar grains such as quinoa and brown rice, boasting 14g of protein per 100g, lots of fiber, excellent quantities of vitamins B1 through B6, and it's got multiple minerals such as manganese, zinc, and magnesium.

You can use it in salads instead of brown rice, bulgur, or quinoa. It pairs excellently with middle-eastern flavours such as olive oil, coriander, cumin, and lemon. It's great in stews: leave it for an hour to absorb the flavour of your stock and it becomes even more heavenly. It's extremely filling, too! Finally, you can use it as a simple side dish as well, to accompany meat, vegetables, or other forms of protein.

The only difficulty is that it may be slightly difficult to find, and a little bit more expensive depending on where you are. Here in the UK, I can find it at my local arab supermarket for £5/kg, but if you're anywhere near the Middle-East, you can get it for much, much cheaper.  That amount should be good for around 12 large portions.

So, I'd like to share two of my absolute favourite recipes with freekeh, both by Yotam Ottolenghi:

## Charred shallots cooked in freekeh

[Also available on The Guardian website](https://www.theguardian.com/food/2019/sep/07/yotam-ottolenghis-one-pot-recipes-chicken-porcini-lamb-pilaf-shallot-freekeh)

[PIC](https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a48bdceb0af7da70895de6b9620b7f6e707db1bc/0_0_3036_3581/master/3036.jpg?width=620&quality=45&auto=format&fit=max&dpr=2&s=b0e2d2dd155f9ed856e8d97489dbaca5)

The unique smoky and nutty qualities of freekeh are amplified here with the addition of charred shallots and cascabel chillies. The dish is robust enough to be served as a main course, with some lightly cooked greens or a chopped salad alongside. I know the ingredient list sounds weird - cinnamon, miso, chillies, tahini, and maple together? wtf? - but the flavour profile is absolutely incredible.

Prep 10 min
Cook 1 hr 5 min
Serves 4

3½ tbsp white miso paste (70g) (regular miso works fine, £0.10)
60ml olive oil  (£0.70)  
1½ tbsp maple syrup (£0.10)  
1 tbsp tomato paste  (£0.05)  
5 garlic cloves, peeled and crushed (£0.20)  
¾ tsp ground cinnamon (£0.06)  
500ml vegetable stock  (£0.05)  
Salt and pepper 
350g medium banana shallots (about 8-10), peeled (£0.50)  
3 dried cascabel chillies, roughly broken (can sub regular dried chillies without a problem, (£0.03)  
350g cracked freekeh, soaked in cold water for half an hour, then drained (£1.66)  

**For the tahini sauce**  
80g tahini (£0.60)  
1 garlic clove, peeled and crushed  (£0.04)  
2 tbsp lemon juice (£0.05)  

**To serve (optional)**  
1 tbsp flat-leaf parsley leaves finely chopped (£0.05)   
2 tbsp chives, finely chopped (£0.05)  
3 tbsp olive oil (£0.10)

Whisk the first seven ingredients together in a large jug with 400ml water, a teaspoon of salt and a good grind of black pepper.

Put a large saute pan for which you have a lid on a high heat. Once hot, add the shallots and char for 16 minutes, turning a few times, until slightly blackened all over. Add the cascabels and char for 90 seconds more, until fragrant. Pour over the stock mixture, bring to a simmer, then turn the heat down low. Cover and cook for 10 minutes, until the shallots begin to soften.

Carefully transfer the shallots to a plate for a moment while you stir the freekeh into the sauce, then return the shallots to the pan, spaced apart. Cover with the lid again, and cook for 15 minutes, or until the freekeh is cooked through and most of the liquid has been absorbed. Remove from the heat, leaving the lid on, and set aside for 10 minutes.

Put the tahini sauce ingredients in a small bowl with four tablespoons of water and a quarter-teaspoon of salt, and whisk smooth. In a separate small bowl, combine the parsley, chives and oil.

Drizzle half the tahini sauce over the freekeh, followed by all the herb oil. Serve directly from the pan, with the remaining sauce alongside.

Total cost: £4.61  
Per portion: £1.15

Obviously, the final cost depends heavily on which ingredients you already have at home and this is simply an estimate. 


## Spicy Freekeh Soup with Meatballs

A fantastic stew perfect for cold, winter nights. As is typical with Ottolenghi, there are many, many ingredients, but once again they are pantry staples so it is difficult to provide an exact cost estimate. The recipe can be found in his book he wrote in collaboration with Sami Tamimi, *Jerusalem*. I highly recommend it. Here's a picture of approximately what it looks [like](http://www.veggiesbycandlelight.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Spicy-Feekeh-Soup-2-1-1024x.jpg).

Prep: 20 mins
Cook: 1h

**Ingredients**  
**For Soup:**  
2 tbsp. olive oil (£0.10)  
1 large onion chopped (£0.05)  
3 cloves garlic crushed (£0.10)  
2 carrots peeled and cut into inch cubes (£0.20)    
2 celery stalks cut into inch cubes (£0.08)  
3 large tomatoes chopped (£0.60)  
2 ½ tbsp. tomato paste (£0.05)  
1 tbsp. Baharat spice mix (buy in supermarket or mix, recipe below)  
1 tbsp. ground coriander (£0.05)  
1 cinnamon stick (£0.05)  
1 tbsp. superfine sugar (£0.05)  
1 cup freekeh (£1.00)  
2 cups beef stock (£0.05)  
2 cups chicken stock (£0.05)  
3 ¼ cups hot water  
10 g cilantro chopped (£0.33)  
1 lemon cut into 6 wedges (£0.30)  
**For Meatballs**:  
400 g ground beef or lamb or a combination of both (£2.00)  
1 small onion finely diced (£0.10)  
2 tbsp. flat-leaf parsley finely chopped (£0.05)  
½ tsp. ground allspice (£0.05)  
¼ tsp. ground cinnamon (£0.05)  
3 tbsp. all-purpose flour (£0.01)  
2 tbsp. olive oil  
**For Baharat Spice Mix:**  
*If you're lazy, just throw in ground versions of each in approximate proportions, I've never had that fail me. I didn't bother with the price analysis here because the amounts are so tiny*   
1 tsp. black peppercorns  
1 tsp. coriander seeds  
1 small cinnamon stick coarsely chopped  
½ tsp. whole cloves  
½ tsp. ground allspice  
2 tsp. cumin seeds  
1 tsp. cardamom pods  
½ whole nutmeg grated  

Start with the meatballs. In a large bowl, mix together the meat, onion, parsley, allspice, cinnamon, ½ tsp. salt, and ¼ tsp. pepper. Using your hands, mix well, then form the mixture into ping-pong-size balls and roll them in the flour; you will get about 15. Heat the olive oil in a large Dutch oven and fry the meatballs over medium heat for a few minutes, until golden brown on all sides. Remove the meatballs and set aside.  
Wipe out pan with paper towels and add the olive oil for the soup. Over medium heat, fry the onion and garlic for 5 minutes. Stir in the carrots and celery and cook for 2 minutes. Add the tomatoes, tomato paste, spices, sugar, 2 tsp. salt, and ½ tsp. pepper and cook for 1 more minute. Stir in the freekeh and cook for 2 to 3 minutes. Add the stocks, hot water, and meatballs, Bring to a boil, lower the heat, and simmer very gently for a further 35 to 45 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the freekeh is plump and tender. The soup should be quite thick. Reduce or add a little water as needed. Finally taste and adjust the seasoning.  
Ladle the hot soup into serving bowls and sprinkle with the cilantro. Serve the lemon wedges on the side.

My second ode to Brothy Beans,54,ioxcna,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/ioxcna/my_second_ode_to_brothy_beans/,8,1599613122.0,"PIC: [https://i.imgur.com/YLspfyw.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/YLspfyw.jpg)

I just whipped this up for lunch and wanted to share my undying love of brothy beans (again) with this sub.

They are so ridiculously versatile and easy to prepare. Today, I made brothy beans with spinach and a fried egg. The recipe is as follows:

**INGREDIENTS:**

A little oil for sautéing 

1 yellow onion, peeled and diced

5 cloves garlic, peeled and minced

Crushed red pepper to taste

16 ounces chopped tomatoes (fresh or canned)

A little butter, optional

4 cups stock, broth, or water

Dry herbs, such as thyme, parsley, chives, or rosemary

1 can white beans, cannellini, chickpea, great northern, or navy; drained and rinsed

5 ounces spinach, arugula, baby kale, or any other green you like

Salt and pepper to taste

Eggs, for serving, optional

&#x200B;

**PREPARATION:**

1. Start by sautéing the onion in a little oil over medium heat. Add the garlic and season with crushed red pepper
2. Add the chopped tomatoes and cook until they start to break down and bubble, about 5 minutes. Season with salt, pepper, and crushed red pepper. Add a little butter, optional (makes for a richer broth but not necessary)
3. Pour in the stock and bring to a boil. Season to taste with dry herbs. I used a few shakes of thyme, parsley, and chives. Pour in the beans. Reduce heat and simmer for 20 minutes until the broth thickens a bit.
4. Right before serving, add the spinach and season again with salt, pepper, and crushed red pepper to taste. Turn off the heat as soon as the spinach has wilted.
5. Serve with a fried egg on top.

It takes like...25-30 minutes to make and tastes SO good.

You can add different proteins to this too, like chicken, sausage, fish, or shrimp. I've also served it with a hearty, crusty bread and it's so filling and delicious.

A splash of lemon juice makes it tasty, too! This is just one of those recipes I whip up regularly because I almost always have all the ingredients on hand – sometimes I omit the greens if I don't have it – and it's super easy to make.

You can add other vegetables to this too. I've roasted broccolini or cauliflower until charred and piled it on top. You can add roasted bell peppers or cabbage, too. 

It's absolutely one of my most favorite things to make!",eatcheapandhealthy

Salads are the ultimate customizable and easy meal of all time.,1189,iojc9j,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/iojc9j/salads_are_the_ultimate_customizable_and_easy/,129,1599552928.0,"I was looking through my pantry as I always do, and I started to do the ol' pantry stare. Looking at the ingredients I had, I noticed a lot of pantry staples. Beans, rice, onions, cucumbers, potatoes, tuna, pasta, craisins, etc.

Then it got me thinking..

I've made posts before about congee and soup, all being cheap and super ultimate frugal, easy meals. So if there was ever a third, it's got to be salad.


Just think of it, salads are dirt cheap, customizable, fun to eat, and don't take a whole lot of effort. Plus, it never gets boring, if you switch up the ingredients or the dressing. For example, here are some ideas. 

Caesar salad - iceberg lettuce, mustard/mayo, and all you need are bread crumbs. If you don't have, substitute for peanuts, or walnuts, or some other form of crunch. 

Apple Kale salad - Kale, apples however much you want, and balsamic vinegar. 

Tuna salad - tuna, drained. Mayo, lemon juice, oil, and salt and pepper. Toss with lettuce. 

Pasta salad - rotini, elbows, or any type. Mayo, pickle juice, relish, and  carrots, peas and sweet corn. 

Potato salad and more! 

Plus, you can add beans (black, red, lentils, kidney, chickpeas), granola for crunch, cans of sweet corn. Rice or brown rice for filler. Or quinoa for a nice texture. 

Salads are the most custom meal made for the most picky of individuals. 

So now you might be asking, what about the dressing? 

Well, you more then likely already have it in your pantry or refrigerator. 

A classic I use is oil, lemon juice and salt and pepper. Makes a classic dressing for arugula. 

Balsamic vinegar, oil and salt make a wonderful mesh of flavor. 

Take mayo, mustard and boiled yellow egg yolks, and it makes a perfect deviled egg dressing. 

Take some hummus, dilute with water, add lemon juice, and you have hummus dressing. 

Or take spinach, and make a basil spinach pesto! 


Plus, you save cleaning your kitchen stove top, doesn't heat up your home, and is good for your gut, especially if you're eating a lot of carb filled foods like us! 

And if not, dressing is super cheap. It's the salad contents that will leave you puzzled.

Truthfully, this stuff is great for kitchen improv, but I made it with cream cheese, vegetarian refried beans, sour cream, avocado, blender salsa I made last week, shredded cheese, black olives and cilantro. Other options your could add or substitute, especially if you don’t feel like eating the entire dairy section at one time: tomatoes, bell pepper, jalapeño, ground turkey/beef, shredded chicken/pork, scallions, tomatillos, shredded and seasoned potatoes, sweet potatoes, salsa verde, seasoned tofu, taco sauce, black or pinto beans, corn salsa, mango salsa, etc. Dip vessels could include chips and/or slices of veggies.

Equipment

* Medium pot
* 13''x9'' baking dish
* Electric hand mixer

Ingredients

**Strawberry Topping**

* 6 ounces strawberry jello 2 3-ounce packages
* 2 cups water
* 16 ounces fresh strawberries sliced (or use frozen, thawed strawberries)
* 3 tablespoons sugar

**Pretzel Crust**

* 2 cups crushed pretzels or Ritz crackers
* ¾ cup butter melted
* 3 tablespoons sugar
* Butter cooking spray optional

**Cream Filling**

* 8 ounces Cool Whip
* 8 ounces Neufchâtel cheese or use cream cheese
* 1 cup sugar

Instructions

**Prepare the Strawberry Topping:**

* First, macerate the strawberries. Toss the sliced strawberries with sugar in a large bowl and set aside.
* Bring 2 cups of water to a boil in a medium pot. Dissolve the gelatin in the boiling water and turn off the heat.
* Pour the water and gelatin mixture over the strawberries and transfer to the fridge to partially set for 1 hour 30 minutes.

**Prepare the Crust:**

* Preheat oven to 350ºF. Combine the pretzels, butter, and sugar in a bowl. Grease a 13x9'' baking dish with cooking spray. Transfer the pretzel mixture to the pan and use your hands to evenly press the crust over the bottom of the baking dish.
* Bake for 10 minutes and cool the crust as the jello continues to set up.

**Prepare the Cream Filling:**

* During the last 10 minutes of the jello setting up, prepare the cream filling. Combine the Cool Whip, Neufchâtel cheese, and sugar in a bowl and mix with a hand mixer until smooth.

**Assemble the Pretzel Salad:**

* Spoon the cream filling over the cooled pretzel crust and gently spread over the crust. Spoon the partially set strawberries and jello mixture over the cream filling.
* Chill the pretzel salad for at least 6 hours before serving.

**To Serve:**

* Cut into slices and serve with more fresh strawberries or whipped cream, if desired. Enjoy!

It's really unfortunate that my city's seems to be one of the few that has cheaper-than-grocery-store prices. It might be because it's in the midwest and surrounded by rural farming communities, but who knows. Anyway it's always worth a shot of hitting them up and seeing what's for sale since vendors are always changing/there might be someone selling their imperfect produce!",eatcheapandhealthy

Burrito stand beans,6,iny1wm,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/iny1wm/burrito_stand_beans/,7,1599469877.0,"I went with family to the local burrito stand. It's in the food court of a mostly-defunct mall, so of course we call it Mallrito. Their food is really good.

I told myself I will put it there and quickly forget about it, and just take one whenever I’m down there and think, oh I forgot these are still here. But nope. I constantly had the Snickers in the back of my mind and did eat more than I wanted. And that is the problem. Financially, it was a great deal and makes more sense to buy reduced groceries in bulk, but health wise, I can’t really balance my appetite when there is abundance of food around. Another example is using TooGoodToGo, which is great financially, but I can’t portion the sudden available load of food.

Your favourite cheap and healthy schemes...,733,inqjkb,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/inqjkb/your_favourite_cheap_and_healthy_schemes/,97,1599443646.0,"I do a lot of things that I consider clever and frugal around food to avoid waste, keep my food costs low and variety high. I'm putting a list below; I'd love to hear yours!

1. When things are on sale or when I have a lot in the garden, I buy a little extra and ferment some pickles. You can ferment/pickle any fruit or vegetable (through fruit takes a bit more sensitivity to get right) with just salt and water. Ferments are really good for you and cheap to make. You don't need fancy airlocks or fido jars, they can be made in any glass jar. A cheap airlock is a disposable, foodsafe glove on the mouth of the jar with a couple holes poked in the fingertips for air flow. Fermented krauts, salsas, chutneys, pickles and relishes will keep for months after the produce would otherwise have spoiled and they brighten up any food they're paired with. Fruit vinegars are also so easy to make. Apple scrap vinegar with your apple cores makes very nearly the same product as apple cider vinegar while using up something that would otherwise be composted.

2. Use the pickle juice! Pickle juice makes a great base for soups, can be used to cook vegetables or in place of water in any recipe where you want a little more oompf and acid. 

3. Growing things. Even if you are in a tiny appartment, growing spouts in a jar on a windowsill is a great, cheap, really easy source of vegetables to keep things interesting. It's a great thing for kids to learn to do as well and empowers them to know they can grow food wherever they are. You just need a mason jar with a ring and some cheesecloth and beans from the store. 

4. Save bacon fat (or other meat fat) and use it to cook with. Animal fat is an excellent cooking fat and can even be used in place of butter in baking (bacon fat ginger snaps are so good). Butter is expensive (so is meat but if you're already eating it, may as well use all of it).

5. Buy cheap cuts of meat and slow cook them. Always save the fat and broth and use in other dishes. One of the best ways to be a sustainable meat eater is to learn how to use the parts that other people don't want. Tails, feet, heads, etc. There are beautiful traditional recipes for these items all over the world that make delicious food for very little cost.

6. Use dried beans and flavour them - if you're tired of eating beans all the time, one of the best things you can do to make them delicious and new is to rehydrate your own. This is also much much cheaper and adding a little flavour when you're cooking them from dried goes miles towards making them special. I use leftover broth and stocks to make mine and always throw in a bay leaf and some dried onions.

7. Invest in a slow cooker or a pressure cooker. Both of these can be found for very little money in thrift stores. I've bought pressure cookers multiple times for $5. I think this is one of the best investments for frugal and delicious eating. Pressure cookers take all the time out of making beans from dried, making tough cuts of meat tender and making soups in just a few minutes. People are afraid to use them but they're simple and easy and if you learn them, you can benefit by taking them off peoples' hands after they're given as wedding presents to folks who will never put them into service.

8. If you have a little outdoor space or garden space, learn to forage. In many places, there are edible native or naturalized plants growing all over in prolific amounts. Learn them and how to use them - I used to walk home from downtown every day and pick full salads worth of miner's lettuce, nettles, dandilions and sheep sorrel from suburban boulevards. Better if you can grow your own little patches if you're concerned about contamination, of course, but all the same, free is free. 

9. Make your own yoghurt. It's significantly cheaper than buying it. You can buy a four litre jug of milk that makes four litres of yoghurt for a LOT less money than buying it as pre-made yoghurt. All you need is saucepan, a mason jar, a warm place, and a bit of yoghurt from either a store bought batch or the last homemade batch to use as starter.  You can also make a very cheap facsimile of ricotta with whole milk and a bit of acid (whey, lemon juice or vinegar). 

10. From homemade yoghurt you can also make labneh (soft, tart cheese) by straining the yoghurt overnight. Mix the labneh with salt and herbs and garlic for a fancy spread or topping for soup. They whey leftover from ricotta or labneh can be used as a base for stocks, soups or to cook vegetables in (my favourite is turnips boiled in whey and then roasted in the oven with a bit of salt).

Moroccan Semolina Pancake,52,incqk9,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/incqk9/moroccan_semolina_pancake/,4,1599382346.0," **Moroccan Semolina Pancake**

Link to the recipe video:   [Link](https://youtu.be/CkkHukAUDB8)

&#x200B;

**Ingredients:** 

\- Fine semolina (250g) 

\- Flour (50g) 

\- Yeast (1 tsp) 

\- Sugar (1 tsp) 

\- Pinch of salt 

\- Warm water (520 ml) 

\- Baking powder (8g)

**Directions:**

1. Use a blender or food processor to combine all ingredients. Blend on medium to high speed for a solid minute to yield a smooth, creamy batter. If you notice anything sticking to the pitcher or bowl, interrupt the blending to scrape down the sides.

2. Transfer the batter to a bowl 

3. Heat a nonstick crepe pan over medium heat. When hot, stir the pancake batter with a ladle, then slowly pour some batter into the center of the pan, allowing it to spread outward into a circle on its own. (Don't swirl the pan as you would for a crepe.)

4. Cook the pancake without turning until set with no wet spots, about one to two minutes. (You can test the pancake by touching it lightly; it should feel spongy and no batter should stick to your finger.) Transfer it to a clean towel to cool.

5. Repeat with the remaining batter, adjusting the heat if necessary so that the bottoms of the pancakes don't become overly brown. Be sure to cool it in a single layer before stacking them, otherwise they'll stick.

6. Serve Moroccan pancakes dipped in syrup made from melted butter and honey, or serve with toppings and spreads on the side.

No pit fruits, no apples, mangos, avocado, figs, blackberries, etc, . Attempting to go vegetarian 6 days of the week. 

Grains are fine, tofu is fine, root veggies (just not sweet potatoes) are generally okay. Leafy veggies like kale, spinach, and lettuce are fine. Citrus fruits, strawberries, bananas, and kiwis are okay in moderation. Eggplant is okay in limited quantities. Bell peppers are okay when cooked. Spices are fine, and so are the green parts of scallions. 

I’ve got several recipes up my sleeve, but after a year of eating more or less the same 6 recipes on repeat, it’s getting ridiculously repetitive. It’s just ridiculously hard to eat cheap and healthy considering the fact my body won’t tolerate any of my previous go-to foods.

Recipes I use right now:

Asian coleslaw

Pasta with homemade spaghetti sauce and baked tofu cubes

Agedashi tofu

Lemon Baked salmon with rice and  side of cucumbers in a vinaigrette.

Shepard’s pie- trying time find a way to make this vegetarian without using the premade crumbles (my stomach doesn’t like the crumbles for some reason)

Eggplant Parmesan (with vegan cheese and homemade pasta sauce) -this is okay if I have like one or two servings over a several day period, but too many days in a row and I get sick.

"Soup is the ultimate cheap and healthy meal. Take anything you have, boil it in water, and time will do the rest!",4510,im0xcm,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/im0xcm/soup_is_the_ultimate_cheap_and_healthy_meal_take/,309,1599192014.0,"I love soup. It's really hearty, and I like the contrast of drinking almost close to scalding hot soup and then experiencing the flavor profiles as it cools. Cold soup versus hot soup is a real thing. The flavor changes. 

I used to buy Costco roasted chicken, pry off all the chicken and freeze the bones. Do that two or three times and you'll amass enough bones. Or just go to your local butcher and ask for some throwaway bone marrow. Mine usually is never more than $1 a pound and sometimes the butcher throws in extra. Boil that with some vegetables or alone, and you'll get great stock, broth, or soup depending on what you add.  


Even if you're not a meat-eater, some of the best soups I've enjoyed are vegetable-based. Here are some ideas. 

Honestly, take anything you have, and throw it in water, boil it for large amounts of time, and you'll end up with something nutritionally sound, tasty, and hearty. 

Here's one I used to make often!

1 onion, chopped. 

Couple stalks of celery, sliced.

Couple sticks of carrot, peeled and diced. 

Chopped garlic, minced. 

Seasonings of any kind, salt, pepper, cumin, paprika, Italian seasoning. 

&#x200B;

Just having vegetables and nothing else boil in large amounts of water, will give you something so tasty. And honestly, if you're vegan, it's probably even healthier for you too.   


Add cooked rice, quinoa, or barley to create more of a meal, but I usually drink it like that. If you have bacon, fry it up first before cooking and you'll get some nice flavor.

  
Dried mushrooms are a staple in my culture, so we usually rehydrate and cook them with the liquid leftover when we do choose to make it.   


If you have cans of beans, use that for extra flavor. I love the starch that comes in cannellini beans or kidney beans. Chickpeas are a close second. The starch will thicken the soup. 

Add tomato sauce if you want to color, (that's optional) but adds great flavor, or use an old looking tomato that isn't so pretty. Add some form of pasta, if you have it around to add a filler for a fuller meal.

Today I boiled just some leftover carcass rotisserie bones and carrots, and the soup came out so lovely. 

The possibilities are endless here, but bones or not, one vegetable too much or too little, boil the contents in your fridge away, and I'm sure you'll be surprised.",eatcheapandhealthy

For the tortilla:

150g of a.p. flour
90g (about 1/2 cup) of water
1 teaspoon of salt
2 tablespoons of vegetable oil
1 teaspoon of baking powder

Steps:

1. Combine flour, salt and baking powder in a bowl.
2. Make a well and add the water and oil.
3. Mix with a spoon until it comes together and knead for about 8-10 minutes.
4. Cover and let it rest for 10 minutes, then divide into 2-3 parts.
5. Flat the dough out with a rolling pin and place it on a non stick pan on high heat and cook each side for about 30 seconds.

For the onions:

1. Slice on medium-sized onion.
2. Heat a non stick pan on medium high and add the sliced onions.
3. Add a teaspoon of sugar and cook until it gets soft and develops a nice brown color. You might need a splash of water to help it soften.

For the lentils:

1. Place 1/2 a cup of lentils in a small pan and cover with water. Boil for about 5 minutes.
2. Drain the lentils then place them back on the pan.
3. Pour about three cups of water, add one small diced onion and one minces clove of garlic.
4. Boil for about 5 minutes on medium heat, then add 1/2 a cup of a long grain rice and continue boiling for about 12-15 minutes. You might need to add some water.
5. Season with salt and pepper.

That's it, then just assemble and enjoy. Only takes about 30-35 minutes, is quite filling and super cheap.

Shrimp Pad Thai with homemade sauce,30,ilejei,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/ilejei/shrimp_pad_thai_with_homemade_sauce/,5,1599106253.0,"**INGREDIENTS (2 servings)**

100g dried rice noodles for Pad Thai

Shrimp, as much as you like

1.5 cup beansprouts

3-4 garlic chives

50g firm pressed tofu

2 eggs

1 medium shallot

2 garlic cloves

2 tbs shredded sweet preserved radish

1.5 tbs dried shrimps

2 tbs freshly roasted peanuts, skinned

1 lime

Chili flakes to taste

&#x200B;

**Ingredients for sauce:**

100 ml hot water

50g tamarind pulp (about 2.5 tbs)

40g palm sugar (about 3.5 tbs after shaving)

2.5 tbs fish sauce

Optional: 1/2 tbs Sriracha, for color and extra spice

&#x200B;

**TIPS:**

\- Choose a wider type of rice noodle, it has better bite and less likely to break

\- Add a little bit more water to help cooking the noodles if needed

\- Chopping the dried shrimp will bring out more of its flavour, but they stick on the noodles and may be tiring to chew after a while.

\- If you plan to add more noodles or more ingredients, make more sauce, otherwise it will be pretty bland.

\- Always taste and adjust, since different brands of tamarind paste, fish sauce, palm sugar have very different level of salt/acid/sweetness.

\- There are 2 types of Thai preserved radish: salty, and sweet. Just check the label carefully.

\- For palm sugar, we need the light golden one, not the darker version.

\- Make more sauce and keep in the fridge for months!

\- You can substitute shrimp with chicken too.

&#x200B;

**STEPS:**

**1. Preparing Pad Thai Sauce:**

\- Soak tamarind pulp in hot water. Stir and let sit for 20 mins. Strain and set aside.

\- Shave palm sugar disk, add to a sauce pan under low heat, stir.

\- When it is slightly caramelized, add tamarind mixture, continue to stir until dissolved then turn off the heat. Add fish sauce, mix and set aside.

\- Taste: a balance of sweet, sour, and salty.

&#x200B;

**2. Cooking Pad Thai:**

\- Soak dried noodle in cold water for at least 1 hour

\- Chop chives and tofu into 4cm length sticks

\- Roughly chop shallot, finely mince garlic

\- Finely chop sweet preserved radish.

\- Crush peanuts into medium chunks

\- Cut some lime wedges

\- In a large pan under medium heat, add 3 tbs of oil, fry shrimp until cooked, set aside.

\- Add shallot and garlic, fry until fragrant then add tofu, dried shrimp and preserved radish.

\- Add drained rice noodle and a little bit of water. Cook until soft then add sauce and mix.

\- Push the noodles to one side, add oil, crack 2 eggs

\- Break the yolks, spread them out and move the noodles on top of the eggs. Mix well.

\- Turn off the heat, add chives and beansprouts. Mix and let them cook in the remaining heat.

\- Add crushed peanuts, chili flakes to taste, and shrimps back.

\- Serve hot, garnish with extra bean sprouts, chives, lime wedges, some chili flakes, a little bit of sugar. Enjoy!!

My canned borscht recipe

200-500g cheap pork cuts (and/or bone/meat/vegetable  broth)

half of a garlic

3 onions

6 carrots

(+ and/or whatever root vegetables are cheap/and in season.)

6 potatoes

as many beetroots as will fit your pot (I typically use 2 kg for this amount)

1 cup white vinegar or kvas

1 tsp black peppers

1 tsp green peppers

2 bay leaves

liberal amount of fresh or dried parsley

salt to taste

Chop meat into about 1"" pieces. Sear it with onions and garlic in oil/butter. Add finely chopped carrots, peppers, bay leaves, salt and water to cover all ingredients well. Leave to boil on low heat for as long as you have patience for. (1-2 hours is a good start.)

About 40 minutes before you  want to be ready, remove bay leaves and add parsley + the beetroots and potatoes, peeled and chopped into manageable chunks. When they are done, the soup is ready. Add vinegar (or kvas) to taste.

Can the soup in sterilized (oven/boiling) preservation jars when it is boiling hot and close the lids - when it cools it will create a vacuum seal. Take care in handling hot jars, rubber gloves and oven mittens will help you with them!

Ingredients:
1 can of diced tomatoes, 1 jalapeño, garlic, salt, tajin, lime juice (the last 4 are optional and also to taste)

Essentially you just need to chop up the jalapeño and garlic (garlic powder will work in a pinch) very finely (leave the jalapeño seeds if you want spice). Then, put the tomatoes, garlic, and jalapeños in a blender or food processor and blend to your desired consistency.

It can be rather bland without any seasoning, so i put salt and tajin in mine.

"I learned about Thai Pork Cucumber Soup two days ago and it's a unique way to use the veggie that a lot of us probably have in surplus right now! Plus, it's only like 360 calories per serving.",12,ikack5,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/ikack5/i_learned_about_thai_pork_cucumber_soup_two_days/,4,1598949712.0,"**PIC:** [**https://i.imgur.com/EefYW9L.jpg**](https://i.imgur.com/EefYW9L.jpg)

**Recipe here originally:** [**Thai Pork Cucumber Soup**](http://triedtrue.us/PorkCucumberSoup)

Someone told me about Chrissy Teigan’s Thai pork stuffed cucumber soup and I knew I wanted to try making my own version of it. 

The woman who posted it to our group shared Chrissy Teigan's recipe and she said she felt like the version she ate growing up had more cilantro or spices in it. I did a little hunting and found a version on Cookpad by Kanya from Thailand which uses LOTS of cilantro. Kanya's version uses tofu, which I didn’t have, so I omitted that.

Obviously, both versions are probably equally tasty, but I was definitely intrigued by the white pepper in the pork from Kanya's recipe, so that's what I used as my starting point.

This is a really easy recipe and a unique take on a really cheap veggie that most of us are probably swimming in this time of year!

# SUBSTITUTIONS:

Ground Pork: Ground chicken or ground turkey

Cucumber: Seedless or seeded, doesn't matter

Ground White Pepper: Use black pepper instead – it won't have exactly the same flavor, but it's ok.

You can follow Kanya's method and add tofu to it, as well!

# RECIPE

## Equipment

* Large pot

## Ingredients

## Pork Mixture

* 1 pound ground pork
* 6 cloves garlic peeled and minced
* 3 tablespoons soy sauce
* ½ tablespoon sesame oil
* 1-2 teaspoons sriracha, chili oil, sambal oolek or crushed red pepper to taste
* 1 teaspoon ground white pepper
* ¼ cup fresh cilantro leaves and stems minced (see note)

## Cucumber Soup:

* 2 large cucumbers
* 6 cups water or low-sodium chicken stock
* 3 tablespoons soy sauce
* ½ tablespoon sesame oil
* 1 bunch cilantro stems minced (see note)
* 1 teaspoon black pepper
* 1-2 teaspoons sriracha, chili oil, sambal oolek or crushed red pepper to taste
* 1 scallion minced; white and green parts separated
* Salt, to taste
* Sesame seeds optional, for garnish

## Instructions

## Prepare the Broth:

* Combine the water, soy sauce, sesame oil, minced cilantro stems, black pepper, sriracha, and white part of the scallion in a large pot and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer as you prepare the rest of the ingredients.

## Prepare the Cucumbers:

* Peel the cucumbers and cut into three or four pieces depending on the length. Using the back of a spoon, hallow out the seeds and discard them. Set aside.

## Prepare the Pork Mixture:

* In a bowl, combine all of the ingredients for the pork and mix until well-combined.

## Stuff the Cucumbers:

* Carefully stuff the cucumbers with the pork. Roll any remaining pork into small meatballs.

## Boil the Cucumbers:

* Turn the heat on the broth to a vigorous simmer. Carefully drop the cucumbers and meatballs into the soup and cook for about 15-20 minutes until the pork is completely cooked through and the cucumbers have softened. Turn off the heat.

## To Serve:

* Ladle the soup into bowls. Garnish with extra cilantro leaves, minced green part of the scallion, and sesame seeds. Enjoy!

## Notes

*In this recipe, you can use 1* [*small*](https://www.wikihow.com/video/f/fd/Chop%20Cilantro%20Step%207%20Version%202.360p.mp4) *bunch of cilantro. Cut the cilantro right beneath where the bunch becomes leafy and mince the stems. Use about 1/4 cup of the leaves for the meatballs and use any remaining cilantro as garnish. If you have a very large bunch,  just use discretion on how much cilantro you want to use!*

Recommendations for a good slow cooker?,2,ik9vtq,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/ik9vtq/recommendations_for_a_good_slow_cooker/,34,1598947968.0,"I’d like to buy an Instant Pot or something similar but I’m very overwhelmed by the available options. I don’t really understand the difference between their pressure cookers and their general slow cookers, I also don’t know if Instant Pot is actually the best brand to buy.

My boyfriend and I are college students and trying to live frugally. We’re both inexperienced cooks, but enjoy experimenting with different recipes and flavors. Our favorite thing to make is chicken matzo ball soup, which we’ll usually make a huge pot of at a time so we can eat it throughout the week.

Even though I enjoy cooking with my boyfriend, I don’t do it very often. I have chronic fatigue and gastrointestinal problems (undiagnosed cause), which often leave me with very little energy to cook and a small appetite. More days than not, I will go for days eating very little. I’m hoping a slow cooker will make cooking a less intensive process so I’m more motivated to make healthy food instead of relying on frozen pizzas, boxed mac n cheese, and crackers. I’d also like a big enough model so that we can cook about a week’s worth of food at a time, and something that’s versatile so we can trying different kinds of recipes.

It would also be helpful if we can set timers on the slow cooker because we both struggle with time management and tend to get distracted easily. Of course we can always use our phone timers but it’s just nice to have it built into the device.

If anyone has recommendations for other kitchen tools/appliances that might be useful to us, please let us know. Thanks in advance!",eatcheapandhealthy
12 meals for $12 in 1 Hour,94,ik9shw,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/ik9shw/12_meals_for_12_in_1_hour/,13,1598947632.0,"I wasn't feeling great yesterday so wanted to prep simple foods that I could mix and match for lunch and dinner the rest of the week. These ingredients are mostly pantry/fridge staples and are fairly healthy and cheap, took me an hour to prep this. 

Ingredients:
$1.68 = 2 $0.88 cans of beans, I used kidney and black (cook dried ones for cheaper!)
$.98 = can of corn
$1 = sweet potato 
$2.29 bag of romaine (buy heads of romaine for cheaper!
$1.18 = 2 $0.59 limes
$3.49 salsa (16 oz, I'll only use less than half)
$2.89 cheese
$1.99 flour tortillas (12 count, I'll use less than half)
$0.39 yellow onion 
$.50 = .5 lbs of white rice 
$1.29 6 oz tomato paste (I used 3 oz)
$1 = 2 cup bulgar 
$1.29 taco seasoning pack (I DIYed with my spices for cheaper) 

This all comes out to just under $20. I spent $12 worth due to left over salsa, tortillas, bulgar, cheese, and tomato paste plus DIY taco seasoning.

Also need: oil, salt, black paper, hot sauce (optional), corn starch (optional)

First I roasted the sweet potato. First step is to scrub it, then chop into 1/2"" pieces and sprinkle with oil, salt, pepper. Roast at 400F for 35 minutes. 

Then I cooked the rice, mixed in 3 oz of tomato paste when it was done. Could do diced tomatoes, or actually make Spanish rice.

While rice was cooking, I heated up oil in a pan, added onion and cooked until translucent. Added beans, a little salt, black pepper. I wanted it to be a thick consistency so I added a little water and cornstarch but that's not necessary. Cook until thickened, then take off heat. 

Then I cooked the bulgar in sauce pan, 1:1 ratio of water (splash more water) over medium heat. Once bulgar is soft and has absorbed water (add more water if necessary), add taco seasoning. This is my ""ground beef"" replacement. 

Use these ingredients to make burritos, burrito bowls, taco salad, really whatever your heart desires. My favorite combinations so far:
- thin layer of rice, thin layer of bulgar, topped with sweet potato, bean/onion mixture and cheese 
- two big handfuls of romaine lettuce topped with warmed beans and salsa
- burrito filled with everything!

It'll last longer than you think it will since it's pretty much only used in dressings and to add flavor.

Okay! Grab a bag of coleslaw mix (maybe $1.50 ish at the store) and one to two packs of ramen (typically like $0.25 each). Grab a mixing bowl. I like to mix the sauce with tablespoon measurements because I hate doing dishes and I hate having to wash measuring cups. Put the following into the mixing bowl:

2 tablespoons of honey

2 to 3 tbs of sesame seed oil

6 to 10 tbs of olive oil

5 ish tbs of white vinegar

1 to 2 tbs of soy sauce

&#x200B;

Mix. Dump in your coleslaw, and toss. Crumble up a packet of ramen noodles (do NOT add the flavor packet). From here, you can enjoy, but for best results, leave it sealed in your fridge overnight to let the flavors soak in. You can honestly wait to add the ramen noodles until right before you eat if you like super crunchy bits. Personally, I like mine a little softer, so I add my ramen noodles and let it sit overnight.

It’s easy and so cheap, filling and healthy. If you like all the ingredients individually, try it together. Here it goes:

One can of tuna
One can of mushrooms
A serving of white rice
A serving of frozen peas

Cook rice and peas. Drain tuna and mushrooms. Add all ingredients in a bowl and mix together. Add salt, pepper, soy sauce, and the optional sriracha. When full, put lid on and save for tomorrow. 

We usually make one cup of rice and a bag of frozen steam in bag peas, and my fiancé and I split both the bag of peas and the rice and then one can of mush and tuna for each of us. Often there is enough for someone to eat it the next day.

Make miso soup your new best friend!,1973,ijk8d7,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/ijk8d7/make_miso_soup_your_new_best_friend/,186,1598849405.0,"*Why You Should Make This*: cheap, quick, and filling.

*Overview*:

One of the biggest problems when trying to eat and cook frugally is the problem of not feeling satisfied after eating.

Enter your new best friend: miso soup. You have probably tried this before, but it’s a staple of Japanese cuisine. MFK Fisher describes miso as to Japanese food as olive oil is to Italian food or butter is to French food.  Miso is an incredibly versatile, umami-rich flavouring agent which you can incorporate into sauces, marinades, dressings, or even just spread onto grilled food. 

But let’s talk about miso soup. You’ve probably had it before - freeze dried packets you mix into boiling water.  Don’t do that - it’s expensive, and not half as good.  Make good miso soup. Save money. Here’s how. 

*Recipe and Ingredients*

1)  Soy sauce (1 tbsp):  if you have both, use a 1:2 part ratio of dark to light soy sauce, but it doesn’t really matter

2) Sugar (1 tsp): you can also use mirin (a Japanese sweet condiment) but any sugar works fine. If you’re low-carbing, just cut it; don’t use artificial sweetners. 

3) Dashi (2.5 cups):  dashi is a Japanese broth made from seaweed and dried fish. Honestly, just buy powdered instant dashi. It’s almost as good. If you’re vegan, use kombu dashi - which has no fish, and you can make at home very easily if you can’t find it at the store. 

4) Miso paste (1 to 4 tbsp): for soup, recommend white (shiro) miso (which is light and a little sweet), or red (aka) miso (which is saltier and stronger). Try to avoid hatcho miso which is very dark and thick because it’s usually too salty.   Add more or less miso to adjust the flavour; start with less. 

5) Optional: vegetables (green onion, mushrooms, etc) sliced thin, leftover chicken, tofu, etc

Heat up the dashi, soy sauce, and sugar in a pot; when it’s lukewarm, take a bowl and add the miso and about 2-3 tbsp of the warm liquid and blend it using a whisk.  Once it’s smooth, add it to the pot. Add the vegetables and simmer until they’re warm and tender; about 3-5 mins.   Serves 1 as a meal or 2 as a side dish. 

*Total time*: about 10 minutes. 

Traditional garnishes include ground red pepper and sesame seeds, or roasted seaweed. 

This recipe is infinitely flexible - any and all of it can be adjusted. A more traditional recipe (less robust) uses only dashi, miso, and vegetables - but I like the flavour.   

A bowl of this will come in at under 80 calories, but is very filling and nutritious - a perfect way to make a meal feel more filling. 

*Cost*: 

Hondashi stock is about $4 per 60g bag which makes about 50 L of stock (use about 3g in this recipe): $0.20

Miso paste: 500g is about $4 which makes probably 20 tbsp servings: $0.20

Both last upwards of 6 months in the fridge. 

Total cost: roughly $0.45 per serving. 

Compare with instant miso soup at roughly $0.75 a serving for worse, less flexible food that takes almost the same time to prepare.",eatcheapandhealthy

I take one container of low sodium chicken bone broth (32oz), pour it in a large pot and bring it to boil. When it’s boiling, add in about 16oz of pasta...anything will do but I usually use whole wheat macaroni or rigatoni. Once the pasta is in, set it to a very low simmer until the pasta is cooked. You don’t want to keep it boiling because then the bone broth liquid will cook off. Once it’s done I mix in some Parmesan and cheddar cheese and it makes a nice soupy sauce with the pasta. If you want to be less healthy you can also add in a chunk of butter to melt into it. You could probably add vegetables to this but I like to just top it with grated Parmesan.

I’ve been here for ages, but recently things have changed. As the title says, I had a medical emergency and our budget is stretched ultra thin. My partner also has a new job that is 9-10hours/day and very labor-intensive.

Up until Covid, we were mainly eating yellow rice + quinoa with a can of peas/corn/carrots mixed in, baked potatoes, black beans, Asian stir frys with frozen veg, and French toast waffles. We moved in with a couple that can’t seem to do any dishes, so we’ve resorted to takeout a lot lately. Also, they’ve been the main cook in the relationship up until now.

The worst part is that our diet/tastes seem so different. I’m allergic to a lot of food, and SO won’t eat anything that they can’t smother in Sriracha (somehow can still taste the food underneath...? I checked). **Any and all recommendations welcome.**

1. We don’t eat breakfast except on days off. We’d be willing to change that, but we hate oats and don’t want to power up the gas stove in the morning.

2. I’m allergic to nuts (except almond), seeds, coconut, and shellfish. They won’t eat lentils or fish except for canned tuna. They also dislike spinach and sweet potato, but will eat them in small amounts when drowned in seasoning and with other food.

3. Meat is extremely expensive around here, we can afford maybe a pound per week.

4. When they get hungry at work, they always take out. I need ideas for meals they can take with them to work that can go unrefrigerated for 4-5hours.

5. Our grocery list is basically: sauces, rice, seasonings, black, pink, and navy beans, pasta, pasta sauce, salsa, tortillas, frozen vegetables, carrots, mushrooms, greens mix, apples, one type of meat, eggs, margarine, frozen waffles, nondairy milk, cheese, bread.

Any suggestions? I’ll be heading to the food pantry when I can, and we don’t qualify for food stamps.

2. Fry your diced onions in a bit of oil until brown

4. Add the chopped soya chunks and fry for another 5 minutes or so. Salt to taste.

5. Serve with whatever. Works well with rice, bread, garlic bread, anything really

I didn't include the price of oil or spices are they are really cheap but it would still cost under £1

I think the article's a nice read, but here's the recipe:

Rutabaga Noodles Cacio e Pepe

Serves 4-6

**Ingredients**

1 large rutabaga

9 tbsp. cold butter, divided

¼ cup finely minced shallot

10 whole black peppercorns

¼ cup dry white wine

¼ cup heavy cream

½ tsp. kosher salt, plus more to taste

Grated pecorino or parmigiano cheese, to taste

Fresh-ground black pepper

Minced chives, for garnish

**Directions**

1. Prepare the rutabaga noodles: Remove the thick, brown outer layer of the rutabaga with a paring knife or a sturdy vegetable peeler. Shave the rutabaga into thin ribbons using a mandoline or a vegetable peeler. (It may be necessary to cut the rutabaga into halves or quarters to do this more easily.) Cut the rutabaga ribbons lengthwise into half-inch strips, and, if you like, square off the ends.
2. Make the beurre blanc: Cut 8 tablespoons of the butter into chunks and set aside in a cool place. Heat the remaining 1 tablespoon butter in a medium saucepan and stir in the shallots and peppercorns. Cook, stirring, for about one minute, until the shallots are aromatic but not beginning to brown. Add the wine and cook until almost entirely reduced, with about two tablespoons remaining. Add the cream and salt and reduce again. (If the pan looks too dry, stir in a tablespoon or two of water.) Add the remaining chilled butter, one piece at a time, stirring briskly with a wire whisk with each addition, continuing to whisk until the sauce is shiny and thick. Strain out the solids (or keep the shallots and just fish out the whole peppercorns). Taste and add more salt, if necessary. Cover and keep the beurre blanc warm over low heat until the rutabaga pasta is ready.
3. Bring a pot of unsalted water to a boil. Add the rutabaga noodles and blanch for 3 minutes, until just barely softened. Strain the noodles and add them to the pot with the warm beurre blanc. Raise the heat to medium and gently toss the tagliatelle in the butter sauce until the noodles are softened and the sauce clings to each strand, about 4-5 minutes. Serve topped with grated cheese, freshly ground black pepper, and a sprinkle of chives.",eatcheapandhealthy
Looking to stretch $200 grocery budget a little further,22,ihsm6u,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/ihsm6u/looking_to_stretch_200_grocery_budget_a_little/,37,1598588084.0,"Hello all!  I’m not sure if this is the best place for this, but my girlfriend and I were looking for ways to stretch our groceries a little longer and I was looking for some advice. 

What we initially did was went through a couple of books and magazines with topics like “5 ingredient meals” and built a shared grocery list off of this, that way we can mix and match and not get bored. I’m looking for substitution, additives, or any alterations that will help is stretch our budget further. I’ll include background information and the list below:

**2 people and ~$200 budget/month**

**Grocery List:**

- Pasta (Spaghetti, Macaroni, etc. Box)
- Pasta Sauce (canned/jar)
- Alfredo Sauce (jar)
- Noodles (rice, Egg, Dumplings, etc. Box)
- Chicken Broth (box)
- Salsa/Queso
- Rice (5lb bag)
- Flour (unbleached, wheat)
- Beans (Pinto, Cannelli, etc. canned)
- Onions
- Potatoes (5lb)
- Broccoli (fresh)
- Corn (canned)
- Tomatoes (fresh)
- Peppers (fresh)
- Other Assorted Vegetables (misc.)
- Ruffage (fresh)
- Bananas
- Other Assorted Fruits (fresh)
- Link Sausage/breakfast sausage
- Chicken Breast ($1.99lb)
- Oatmeal/Cereal (quick oats ~2lb/off brand bag)
- Loaf of bread (Any)
- Bagels/English Muffins
- Tortillas (20 count)
- Shredded Cheese: Italian Blend, Mexican
- Eggs (18 count)
- Milk/Half & Half (1 gallon)
- Butter (4 sticks, ~$0.84)
- Refrigerated Dough (Biscuits, Croissant, Pizza)
- Cooking Oil/Olive Oil (as needed)
- Tea (as needed)
- Coffee (Folgers 30 oz., as needed)

**Additional information:**

- We usually run out of bread, eggs, and milk halfway in and “splurge” on more
- Somethings we don’t have to buy every month (e.g. rice)
- There are things we buy on occasion, but not consistently (e.g. lemonade mix, condiment sauces, spices etc.)
- Somethings are just examples, like for noodles, we buy maybe one type per month, not all types listed
- We slow-cook a lot and usually get two meals out of each dish (dinner + lunch next day)

My girlfriend and I have been pretty much living on Doordash lately because between COVID and the California wildfires and just general stress-fatigue, it's been really difficult to go to the store and cook and all that. Unfortunately, those costs add up REAL quick and we're both feeling pretty gross from all the unhealthy foods. We were planning to go to the grocery store to stock up on ingredients recently, but then our refrigerator broke. Since it came with the apartment, we let the property managers know and they were nice enough to send someone to swap out the fridge with a new one. Cool, right?

Well, the new fridge is tiny. Way smaller than the last one, and we live with two roommates who also need room to keep their stuff! In short, we're pretty low on space for meat and veggies and other things that require refrigeration. It looks like we're going to be relying more on shelf-stable and canned goods to make it through this little 2020 apocalypse. So like the title says, any recipes that employ mostly or all ingredients that don't need a refrigerator would be greatly appreciated. Bonus points for cheap, healthy, and/or quick ones, though I know it's hard to do all three of those.

I hope you will give this a try and we level up our spring rolls and the sauce game!

[Here's how I roll my way to deliciousness](https://youtu.be/YG0jfpXUU4s)

**IMPORTANT TO KNOW:**

* The combi of greens that I used is commonly used in Vietnam and it gives good balance of taste and texture. For home eating, some people also added: shredded carrots, egg strips, perilla leaves, fish mint, even otaheite apple’s young or mango young leaves (for its sourness) etc.
* You can use pork belly, or a cut of pork that has some fats in it. I went shopping too late so I had to use tenderloin ;)
* Rice paper with more tapioca starch + thicker = easier to roll for beginners but can be chewy. The ones with more rice flour + thinner = harder to roll, but more delicious!
* A roll that is packed firmly with layers of ingredients will taste better, not messy to eat, and less likely to break.
* Pork slices and other moisture rich ingredients should be wrapped inside the greens so that they don’t touch the rice paper. If not, it may cause breakage.
* There are different brands of fish sauce, hoisin sauce, peanut butter, salted bean etc so always taste and adjust accordingly.
* I used Healthy Boy Salted Soya Bean Paste. I noticed some brands added soya sauce, and this is not so good for the sauce. Just check the ingredients carefully.
* These 3 sauces are not the only ones that can be used to dip with Gỏi cuốn. But they are more widely used, more palatable and easier to eat to most people.

1. There's any supposed food science reason for the boiling water volume being so high that improves the texture and end result, or if my bad results were just a dud/fluke, and
2. If anyone thinks there's be anything wrong with sealing the baking soda/barley syrup/water mixture airtight and then reboiling it for subsequent bagels at later times.

The sauce is basic:

* grated garlic and ginger fried off gently in oil
* (homemade) Chinese five spice mix and red pepper flakes added to bloom
* soy sauce and a small amount of brown sugar stirred in
* cornstarch slurry added and cooked until thick

At this point I add the protein (that I previously fried) fry and serve with said rice and veg side.

I've been looking for something to cut through this sauce that I can add to the dish, something to provide some acidity perhaps, maybe some kind of fruit? I've made the dish using sirloin beef, chicken breast, seitan, and tofu, and all the times I would always be left wishing there was something bright I could add to the rice. 

Here's a few things I've tried that haven't cut it:

* A basic egg fried rice with some carrots and peas
* Added rice vinegar to the rice
* Added Mirin to the rice
* Added Shaoxing Wine to the rice

If this was a non-Chinese dish and it was say a meat gravy I'd look towards adding cranberry sauce or something similar to another part of the dish to impart what I'm looking for. Just that touch of sweet acidity and slight fruity notes that can cut through the heavy flavours that come with such a sauce. I could make the sauce lighter but I was looking for something to add to provide the contrast on the plate, rather than giving up on the flavour profile I have already.

Not too sure where to start looking, I thought perhaps pineapple could be a starting point but I'm not sure if that's too juicy of a flavour. Maybe some kind of pickled fruit? Pickled mango or something?

1 1/2 teaspoon salt

120 grams flour

4 eggs

In another book they add some corn starch and baking powder...

Regarding freezing/thawing/baking dishes - specifically pans of lasagna and enchiladas.,6,jc0ed3,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskCulinary/comments/jc0ed3/regarding_freezingthawingbaking_dishes/,7,1602839728.0,"I cook a lot, but I don't have much experience with cooking dishes, freezing them, and then thawing/baking them.  
  
My mom is having surgery this weekend and I've been working on prepping some dishes pop can just easily toss in the oven and they can both eat. I've got a batch of chicken soup for a few meals but then I've also been working to prep a pan of lasagna and a pan of shredded beef enchiladas for them. I plan to freeze these to last longer and give instructions to pop on how to defrost and bake them. The dishes will be prepped/frozen in disposable foil pans. I'd like input on the specifics of how to go about that.  
  
Recipes are here, both from Serious Eats: [Lasagna](https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2010/02/no-holds-barred-lasagna-bolognese-pasta-italian-homemade-ricotta.html) and [enchiladas](https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2014/06/shredded-beef-enchiladas-with-three-chile-sau.html). Side note, both dishes are fantastic, /u/j_kenji_lopez-alt lasagna is one of the best dishes I've ever had - not even just best I've ever cooked.  
  
So I'd like to know:  
1. Should I bake either dish pre-freezing? *Note: if it matters, the lasagna noodles are fresh, not dried. Also, both dishes will be assembled with cool-to-room-temp ingredients since I've already made the ragu and shredded beef and they're both in the fridge currently.*  
2. I can assume an overnight thaw. My gut tells me bake for some time covered with foil at a lower temp and then uncovered at a higher temp. I'd like suggestions on time/temp for both steps or alternate ways of approaching it.

How do I know if frozen food is unsafe to eat?,0,jc08vk,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskCulinary/comments/jc08vk/how_do_i_know_if_frozen_food_is_unsafe_to_eat/,5,1602839143.0,"Hey so, long story short, I left my frozen food in a broken fridge for like 18h. Might even be 24h. I didn't notice because I ate takeout yesterday and didn't check the fridge.

I had a few strips of bacon, some fish nuggets, smoked beef slices, and green peas in the freezer. Eggs on bottom fridge but I don't think my eggs are gonna go bad. I moved them to another freezer just before writing this post (not the eggs) but they were no longer cold. Gonna move them back to the broken freezer once it's fixed, then I'll decide what to do with them.

How do I know if they're unsafe to eat? Does meat actually become unsafe BEFORE they smell or taste bad? And does cooking kill the bacteria that makes them unsafe to eat? Does overcooking?

I don't want spoiled food to ruin a future meal, or even give me a stomachache (actually I'm cool with diarrhea, just no nausea/vomiting), but I would prefer not to throw them out because restocking them means I won't be able to buy useless expensive stuff online until next month.

*Edit*

So it looks like Guar Gum and Xanthan Gum are two contenders. 

From what I can find, both act fairly similarly, with Guar needing more time to hydrate and activate than Xanthan, and Xanthan working almost instantly and at basically any temperature (i.e. not needing to be brought to a boil first, works at room temp). 

Both can be difficult to incorporate without clumping, and dissolve better in oils. I think they're both stabilizers, helping to prevent things from separating, which I think should prevent leftover gravy from separating into a solid mass with the water sitting on top. Xanthan gum seems to be the more expensive option. 

The best route might be to use a combination of thickeners, because Xanthan at least can produce a slimy texture if too much is used. I don't know about ratios but I might try getting a sauce halfway to the thickness I want with cornstarch, and the rest of the way with Xanthan/Guar.",askculinary

Surface area of heat exchanger could be utilized, if I could create one or DIY something to that effect. I want a pot that retains a lot of heat but also gives it to the food inside quickly.

Maybe the metal of the bottom of the pot it should be high conductivity to both capture heat from the flame and give it off to the oil inside. Or am I thinking about 'conductivity' in the wrong way? Assuming two pans of equal heat capacity and mass and volume and shape, if one is more conductive than the other, would it heat oil inside faster?

1. I could cook the rice in the evening and then set on 'keep warm' for the whole night (my rice cooker is a Zojrushi and has even an **extended keep warm** setting which lowers the temperature a little bit in order to keep more moisture.  


2.

- peach

- pineapple
- frozen spinach
- baby arugula
- cucumber
- fresh ginger (used a lot today, I bet it was almost ¼ cup)
- probiotic packet
- 2 scoops of whey protein concentrate
- unpasturized apple cider vinegar (I rarely use this, but the bottle was almost empty, so I tossed it all in, and it was a little more than I really meant to put)
- apple juice

...and guys, I'm telling you, it doubled in size. It formed a really thick foam. Not stiff peaks or anything, but almost soft peaks. Almost. You dip your finger in it, and a little bump will stay there until you stir it away.

It tastes fine, other than the fact that I added too much ginger and ACV, so it's a little spicy and tart. Which I don't really mind. I wouldn't make it again, but it's kinda interesting.

But why on earth did it foam up so much? My first thought was that maybe the probiotics or whey had baking soda that reacted with the vinegar, but I checked, and neither of them do. This foaminess definitely feels like microbiotic activity, but I use these probiotics all the time and they've never had this effect. Unpasteurized vinegar is probiotic too, but I've never seen it react like this.

All my ingredients were fresh or frozen. The bottle of apple juice was just opened for this specific smoothie. Nothing was expired or even close. The ACV was old AF, but...it's vinegar. It's already in it's most decomposed state! I know protein can help sustain a foam, but I use protein powder in smoothies all the time, and it's never done this.

While they are all a bit time consuming, I wouldn't say anything I've cooked so far is hugely difficult (to be fair, I've really focused on the simpler french bistro staples I love vs. desserts and the more complex dishes). Anyway, was very excited to try the duck confit, was one of few recipes I'd been saving for awhile (personal restaurant fave of mine). Needless to say it was a train wreck. Could now use Reddit's help on trying to figure out where / why it went wrong.

\- Bought 2 duck legs at Whole Foods (I think they were a bit too small, may be part of the issue); they were in a pack that was sealed but still behind the butcher glass; I tried a butcher shop near me first and they only had sealed whole ducks so I decided to pass

\- Made the ""green salt"" and seasoned the legs with it (approx. 1 tbsp per leg); let sit covered in fridge for \~24 hours

\- Dried off the legs and submerged them into the duck fat (french duck fat brand from Amazon, seemed legit) which then went into the oven. I think this may be part of issue because I'm using an older Wolf range oven and the dials are a bit worn down, I put it as close the the 200 degree mark as I could (Keller recommends 190)

\- Let it cook for 10 hours per TK; my place smelled (D)ucking incredible all day btw

\- Let the duck legs cool down, removed from the fat and let them get to room temp

\- While preparing sides generally followed the recipe; I put the duck legs in a non-stick pan (medium) with a little bit of the duck fat and let them go for \~5 minutes. I definitely think I overcooked a bit here, instead of golden brown was more a dark brown (or this was indicative of my prior mistakes). At this point from the outside they still looked generally good though

\- Finished in over for \~6-7 minutes at 350 degrees

So bite in and pretty obvious I overcooked tf out these duck legs, not to mention they were also very salty - overall way too chewy and the color was much darker than they should be. I'm just trying to figure out where / why this went wrong. Was this recipe meant for massive duck legs I should have sourced better? Is 10 hours in a crock pot in the oven way too much (I notice other recipes call for far less time)? Did I have the temp too high (will be buying an oven safe thermometer)? Did I screw it all up in the end with the frying pan / oven re-heat? Any advice or experience would be much appreciated. To clear my conscience I need to get this right and will be trying again in the near future.

I asked the mods of the sub if this sort of post would be alright, and they said if I included the specific focus of what I was after that it should be fine.

So, over time I've cobbled together relatively fast and cheap recipe for stir fry that I'll make pretty often:

A base (rice or ramen)

* To the water cooking it added:

* 1/2 tsp - Garlic Powder

* 1/2 tsp - Onion Powder

* 1/2 tsp - Red Chili Flakes

* 1 Egg (after cooking)

* If it's rice I mix the egg with an additional 1 tbsp Soy Sauce

Additionally I use some meat (chicken, pork, beef)

* I marinate it with:

* 2 tbsp - Minced Garlic

* 1 tbsp - Soy Sauce

* 1 tbsp - Sesame Oil

* 1/2 tbsp - Worchester Sauce

* 1 tsp - Sriracha Sauce 

* 1/2 tsp - White Pepper

* 1/2 tsp - Cayenne Pepper

* 1/2 tsp - Red Chili Flakes

* Before I cook the meat I sear some vegetables in the pan (which then cook in the marinate with the meat.

Anyways, what I'm looking to adjust is the level of spice in the recipe. I'm not looking to overburden it, but rather just improve it. I've tried a bunch of different variations of where to add which ingredient and when to add it (before cooking the base, or after the entire dish is complete, etc.). So far, the only way I've made it truly unbearable is mixing the Sriracha with the egg that goes into the rice, makes it actually really hard for me to eat.

I was wondering if there were any suggestions of maybe a new spice to add to either the base or marinate, or maybe something to let the vegetables sit in (I don't know if that's really something useful to do like a marinate or put it on while cooking) to more or less introduce a new way for the spices to kick off without it becoming fire while eating it.

I hope this is specific enough to guide, and feel free to let me know if it's not.

After a bit of research I found that several people had been told by customer service that the curve was intentional, a way of compensating for the way metal reacts to heat. That with the application of heat, cooking surface would become flat.

While this sounds like a very fine theory, my personal experience suggests that it's complete bullshit. I heated the pan on low, medium, and then high (by the time I got to high I was intent on returning it anyways) and there was no visible change in the curvature. Oh. and I added a quarter cup of oil for heat transference and to act as a visual cue.

Next I tried ordering some All Clad, the 10 and 12 inch set. Many of *their* representatives claim that the curve is to keep them from spinning on induction stoves. And that they should level out. This time I don't particularity care if it's true, high-end, 'chef-grade' cookware should be designed with gas ranges in mind. The rest of you heathens can suffer for settling on an inferior stove.

Anyhow, the All Clad had an even steeper curve and went strait back in the box. I'm waiting to ship it back until I get a few responses here.

I'm probably going to try the Vollrath Tribute series next but I would like to know if anyone has actually seen their curved pan (any brand) level out. Or know of one that starts perfectly level and stays that way. At this point I don't care what it costs, I just want a pan that works.

I recently rediscovered a piece of cookware that has been sadly neglected for a couple years or so. It’s an enamel coated cast iron skillet from Lodge. 
 
What is prompting this post is that unlike my enamel coated dutch oven where it clearly has an enamel cooking surface on the inside of the dutch oven, this skillet this black matte finish cooking surface. I was wondering on how to properly clean and maintain it as I have clearly forgotten. I don’t believe Lodge offers this particular item anymore so I couldn’t easily find any manufacturers guidance that is geared to this type of finish. 
 
We typically cook with stainless steel and seasoned cast iron cookware (we try to stay away from nonstick coated items as we have birds and are concerned with any potential off gassing that may occur if we over heated the pans. better be safe than sorry). I am pretty familiar on how to use and care for the seasoned cast iron cookware. 
 
Should I be seasoning it like the standard cast iron items or just hand wash and then dry it off like the fully enameled dutch ovens? 
 
Another question I have revolves around enameled cast iron and the application of direct heat. We recently moved to a place which has a gas range. Are there any concerns/steps I need to take when it comes to the direct application of flame to the the enamel surface and maintaining the enamel cookware? 
 
Before this we have always been in places which has an electric range so the enameled cookware was always been exposed to lower heat when compared to direct flames. Seasoned cast iron is perfect for this type of heat and stainless steel doesn’t have a protective coating that could crack rendering the cookware completely useless.

Me and my partner went to an amazing restaurant last night, it was soul food and a lot of things on the menu were made from sweet potatoes.

It came with ice cream but it didn’t even need that. The only thing I know for sure was that it was definitely cooked in a sheet pan and made from sweet potatoes. It was extremely moist and fluffy and just the absolute best cake I’ve ever tasted. It also definitely had some fall spices, maybe some cinnamon and nutmeg. I thought it was soaked in syrup because of how moist it was but It wasn’t extremely sweet so i doubt that. I’m sure it was an old recipe passed down through generations because I’ve looked and looked and can’t find any recipe online that resembles this cake. It was also really dark if that helps. If anyone knows a recipe that makes this cake please share. I am desperate. Btw I already posted this in /askbaking",askculinary

I left onion chunks in there and let them develop some color, too. One small piece of onion did get some char on it. For good measure (or so I thought) I also roasted 2 heads of garlic.

I put all the onion scraps/ chunks along with a sliced “fresh” onion and a small handful of mushrooms in a pressure cooker and set it for an hour.

Some recipees call for 3-4hrs others based on internal temperature roughly 165. The objective is to obviously maintain the juicy meat and fat without drying out?? I note also that juiciness will also come down to the amount of fat to meat as too much the latter will mean a dryer outcome. (I am also trying to source pork belly from fatter pigs.

My local supermarket rotisserie and when I have eaten it at restaurants have wonderful juiciness. The server at the rotisserie informed me that it is ‘steam infused’ which I takeaway  as being cooked in a commercial combi steam oven and I assume restaurants do the same.

Over the past few weeks, I have been attempting to make a new type of food I don't know much about --- a strawberry cheesecake dessert.
I have received this recipe from 「ひだまりクッキング」いちごのレアチーズケーキ ([HidaMari Cooking] Strawberry Rare-Cheesecake).

> ① Crush 100g (plain) biscuits into small pieces, add 30g melted butter, mix and spread into a 15cm mold.  
② Softly stir 200g cream cheese and 90g sour cream, add 30g sugar, and mix completely.  
③ Add 6g powdered gelatin to 30g milk and let soak. Dissolve in a water bath, add to ② and mix.  
④ Make strawberry puree: Rinse 220g strawberries in water, cut off the heads, cut into quarters, and place into a pan and heat. Add 30g sugar and 10g lemon juice. Remove from the heat and use a food processor to puree.  
⑤ Add 80g strawberry puree to ③ and mix. Set the rest of puree aside and let cool.  
⑥ Add 15g sugar to 200ml heavy cream, whisk loosely, then add to ⑤ and mix. Pour into the mold lined with buscuits and chill in the freezer for 1 hour.  
⑦ Make strawberry jelly: Add 5g powdered gelatin to 35g warm water and let soak. Dissolve in a water bath, and mix with 150g strawberry puree. Pour onto the rare-cheese with a now hardened surface and chill in the refrigerator for 1 hour.  
⑧ Make lemon jelly: Add 7g powdered gelatin to 100g warm water.  
⑨ In a pan, add: 100g water, 40g sugar, and 10g lemon juice; heat until, but don't boil. Add gelatin from ⑧ and dissolve. Cool with an ice water bath.  
⑩ Wash strawberries, cut them in half, and place them on top of the strawberry jelly (on the rare-cheese). Pour half of the cool lemon jelly, and chill in the refrigerator for 30 minutes.  
⑪ Pour the remaining lemon jelly onto the strawberries, and chill in the refrigerator for 2 hours to complete.

Many people seem to have success following this recipe, but I am not one of them. I have tried several times following the recipe very carefully and yet I run into the same problems.

Firstly, after watching HidaMori make this, I found my first difference at ② in the recipe. The cream cheese is smooth, until I add sour cream, the cheese curds; however, in her video, everything remains smooth. This again happens at ⑤ when I add the strawberry puree, the somewhat smooth mix curds again. I don't know if this is an ingredient quality issue, maybe I'm not buying the correct type of cream cheese or something. What could be causing this and how can I fix it? Or maybe, does it even matter?

Secondly, my biggest problem lies after ⑦ in the recipe. I place it into the freezer to cool to let set and harden; however, it doesn't. It remains a soft liquid. After 7 hours I can get it to freeze; but then it just melts into a big mess. I don't know what could be causing this. At first I suspected maybe I should add more gelatin, so I doulbed it, but that too didn't work. I was careful with adding the loose heavy cream, too. What could be causing this and how can I fix it?

Otherwise, the rest of the recipe seems simple and goes smoothly. I can make the strawberry gelatin portion without any issues. Thanks in advance for any tips, help, advice for my questions.",askculinary

Thaw turkey in fridge.

Butterfly the turkey. 

Start the maple brine the day before cooking and let it sit (bagged) in the fridge.

Bring smoker up to temp (240) and smoke the meat for roughly 6 hours until the temp reads out at 165. I’ve read that the breast will take the longest on a butterflied bird.

I've been making a mexican style chicken soup in a slow cooker for years. I aways get good reviews on it but personally I know it can be more flavorful and a bit richer.
Typically I start with placing 1.5lb-2lb boneless and skinless chicken breast in the slow cooker and cover it with a can of rotel chopped tomatoes and chillies (I've tried fresh tomatoes and chilies and canned has been better). I let the chicken cook on high for about 4 hours unitl I can pull it apart.
I then shred the chicken breasts and mix in with the juices. At this point I add about 2 qt of chicken broth. Veggies (Onions, Carrots, Celery, Yellow + Green Squash) + cumin + chilli powder + S&P.
I let all the ingredients cook on low for about 3-4 more hours and serve.

A few questions. I'm considering switching to chicken thighs this next go around. The thighs I have in the fridge are bone-in with skin. Should I debone and trim the skin? Or should I cook with skin on and pull the bones when I shred the chicken. 
Second I'm considering searing the chicken in a cast iron pan before I put it in the slow cooker, thinking it may add some additional flavor.

How do I avoid my spaghetti strands from sticking together as they come out of my pasta machine?,59,j9dx40,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskCulinary/comments/j9dx40/how_do_i_avoid_my_spaghetti_strands_from_sticking/,14,1602480499.0,"For almost a year I've enjoyed using my Marcato pasta machine and slowly perfecting my spaghetti over time using 00 flour. However, I'm still having trouble with my spaghetti strands sticking together as they come through the machine at the final stage.

During the process I use appropriate amounts of flour and get the dough to a great, firm consistency which flattens through the roller nicely with occasional dusting. But when it comes to the spaghetti attachment, each batch comes through the crank without problem, except several strands which stick together, resulting in thick clumps when boiled. 

The only solution I can think of is to lay each batch flat once it comes out of the spaghetti attachment and ensure that every strand is separately cut. But this will a) take so much longer, b) negate the point of the spaghetti attachment, and c) probably result in twice as many strands sticking together, before being transferred over to the hanger.

I'm convinced there must be something I can do at the spaghetti attachment stage to ensure that all strands come out the other side completely separated.

Is Boiling/roasting a good method for juicy spiced chicken?,2,j96op5,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskCulinary/comments/j96op5/is_boilingroasting_a_good_method_for_juicy_spiced/,5,1602456563.0,"I've heard Chinese restaurants (in the UK) boil their chicken quite often but it's always so nice. And in my area there is also spiced roasted lamb chops that are also really juicy, so maybe they're also boiled?       

I'm gonna try it out, but online all recipes for boiled chicken stop after boiling, so I had to come and check with you guys.       

Does this sound like it'd work in any way?       
1. I boil the chicken (from cold water) for a minute, then simmer for 10 mins and take out to cool (I was also thinking of adding a few cloves to the water).        
2. Then roast some spices (1-2 cloves, a few peppercorns, a few coriander seeds), crush them, then add oil, garlic, and a pinch each of cinnamon and sage, and 2-3 pinches of paprika, and bloom them and leave to cool.      
3. Baste the chicken with this spiced oil and marinate for the afternoon.          
4. Then when I'm doing other stuff like cous cous, roast kale, and asparagus, I'm going to put the chicken in a roasting hot oven for 10-15 mins to heat up and get that roasted flavour.      

Do any of you think that won't be a hot mess?

My feeling is that as long as you roast it in a low-temp oven, it doesn’t matter if you sear first or later. It actually may even be better to sear first because the meat is still cold so when you finish browning the outer edge of the meat won’t overcook. Whereas if you reverse sear, the steak is almost done coming out of the oven, and it’s easier to overlook the outer edge of the meat cuz it’s no longer cold and almost done.",askculinary

When creating a meal, how should I go about making the courses that surround the main course?  Usually I group things together by theme (i.e. foraged, locally sourced, fish/game) but is there a better way to do it by taste?  Should the dishes be similar in spice usage? Or should they have contrasting tastes? 


For my first intro to the ""meal"", this is my plan so far:


-curried mussels or tomato/garlicy mussels

-a citrusy salad with some sort of light vinaigrette

-halibut cheeks in a lemon bearnaise style sauce with either dill or tarragon (I haven't used tarragon yet)

Can't twist avocados open,1,j8oye6,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskCulinary/comments/j8oye6/cant_twist_avocados_open/,9,1602381279.0,"This is my first time using avocado so please bear with me. According to the chart at the supermarket where I bought the avocados, they'd be ripe in 2-3 days.

They turned a really dark brown colour after 4 days and I opened 2 of them but they were hard as a rock. The brown skin of the pit also remained attached to the flesh for the 1 avocado I did manage to twist open.

I left the other 2 for another 3 more days and they look black now, but I opened one today and it still wouldn't twist off like the videos I've seen. They appear to be firmly stuck at the pit, even though the top half is so mushy it gave when I tried to twist it. What gives? Is it uneven ripening? I chopped it up and the bottom portion was still hard.

If it helps, they were hass avocados. I left them at room temperature the whole time. Pretty bummed out because I was trying to make guacamole and half the ingredients have already rotted just waiting for the avocados to ripen :(",askculinary

500g pasta
30g butter
20g flour
240ml milk (added a bit of milk later on the thin the sauce, probably half a cup)
400g + 400g grated cheese (cheddar + red leicester) 
1tbsp seasoned salt
1tsp MSG
1tbsp garlic powder
1tbsp onion powder
1tbsp paprika


1. I grated the cheese and cooked the pasta Al dente.

2. I made a roux by melting the butter, adding the flour, and cooking over medium low heat for a few minutes.

3. I added the milk and seasonings and whisked for a few minutes.

4. I added half of the grated cheese (200g of each) gradually 50g at a time and whisked until the sauce was mostly melted but with a little bit of clumps. I did this over low to medium low heat (3-4 on my hob).

5. I added maybe half a cup of milk to thin the sauce and continued to heat on 4 until the sauce was smooth with no lumps

6. I added the sauce to the pasta and mixed.

7. I poured the pasta and sauce mix into the ceramic dish in 2 layers, sprinkling grated cheese in-between and a healthy layer on top.

8. I baked at 160°c convection for 30 mins covered with tinfoil on the middle rack.

The recipe said to cook for another 20 mins uncovered but by the time I took the foil off there was already a layer of orange oil on top.

What am I doing wrong? I made sure to only heat the cheese sauce on low/medium-low heat and it still split.

Would it be a better idea, to add the milk at the end of the simmering process? Or should I add the tomatoes at the end?

I know that some classic italian recipes actually do not even use canned tomatoes, and only use tomato purree.

Hi all and thanks in advance. I’m trying to help my elderly mum find a food she had as a child that she hasn’t come across for 60+ years.

For context her dad (my grandad) worked on the canals in the UK and he would sometimes be given small amounts of the food that was being transported on the barges. As many foods were rationed during the war, treats were few and far between and obviously one of these has stuck in her memory.

She has described it as a raw chocholate that was white/off-white in colour that came in shards/chucks with a crunchy honeycomb like texture but was drier and did not dissolve like honeycomb does. It was very sweet and she thinks it tastes like chocolate.

I bought some organic cocoa butter as she saw a picture and thought it looked similar but perhaps was a bit darker. It also wasn’t sweet at all and she said the texture of the cocoa butter was creamy whereas the mystery item was crunchy.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocoa_butter

Any ideas what this might have been? I imagine that this food would have been something transported in bulk during the war. Perhaps a type of raw sugar? I’m really keen to help her relive an obviously strong memory of her childhood.

I push the thermometer through almost to the other end. As I slowly pulled it back towards me the temperature started to increase. I eventually hit the highest temperature point where it then started to decrease. I wanted to find the lowest point which should be the center but it just kept on decreasing forever until I had pulled the thermometer almost back out again, way past the center.

Sous vide the lamb *in* yogurt marinade?,0,j80p21,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskCulinary/comments/j80p21/sous_vide_the_lamb_in_yogurt_marinade/,3,1602284987.0,"So, unfortunately I happen to run into one of the few not-so-good seriouseats recipes, one for lamb biryami, that gave me a totally wrong idea about cooking time when I started it and now my planned evening dinner is in question.

One major thing is to marinade lamb cubes in the fridge for more then two hours and later cooking them for 3hrs (that was the part that was missing at the beginning of the recipe).

So, I got two thoughts how to save this thing and the question is if it would be working or a totally bad idea.

I got my sous vide cooker, and I'm wondering if I can sous vide the lamb cubes inside the marinade to  cook and marinate them same time (spreading it over multiple bags so the heat would still get to the lamb). Sours vide lamb might be even better then 3hrs cooked lamb?

But I don't know if it will break down the enzymes from the yoghurt that were supposed to tenderize the lamb, or if it's a bad Idea for antother reason that doesn't yet occure to me.

Anyone has thought's on this?Thanks already for any ideas.(the cubes I bought are not so big in size)

I am SUPER excited to finally have something to ask!!

So, I am a fan of H mart, a N. American korean supermarket chain.  They're a great asian supermarket with good produce and all your favorite hard to find culinary ingredients (as an American born chinese kid trying to reconnect with his culinary heritage, they almost always have what I need).  I like shopping and buying their off cuts when I see them.  Sometimes it's leftover cut offs from a filleted salmon, sometimes it's a salmon head (i'm learning that salmon head soup is AMAZING and I need to try that recipe one of these days; hit me up if you've got a favorite). 

So what did I find on my most recent trip? I found ""short rib skin"" packaged in a styrofoam under plastic; as I suspected, it was the gristly, silverskin that had been cut off of the short ribs when they were butchering them.  I decided to give it a shot because short ribs are amazing and I figured I could figure something out.  

I ended up cutting them into small strips, seasoning with soy sauce, sesame oil, salt & pepper and stir-frying them with together with some wilted and similarly sliced taiwanese cabbage.  It was...better than expected.  Flavor was great, and the texture was a litle gristly, but otherwise tasted great over rice.  There was sort of a similar snap that you'd get from a braised pig ear or jellyfish that you sometime see at chinese banquets.  All things considered, not a bad experiment; would probably do it again.  

My question for r/AskCulinary is: someone at this store went to the trouble of stacking up pieces of short rib silver skin and sold them for 5.99/lb.  I certainly haven't ever cooked with it before.  Does anyone know the  ""proper"" way these short rib skins are supposed to be cooked? Perhaps in hotpot? I'm sure someone here knows!!

Today I have made homemade fries and even though I done everything I should according to the recipes, the fries were missing most of the crunch. The inside was fluffy like it should be and the taste was great, but the crunch was missing.

My approach:

1) I had the correct starchy potatoes.
2) I cut them to the same size.
3) I let them sit in a water for a bit to let the starch come to the surface.
4) I dried them before frying.
5) First frying - 160 C / 325 F - six minutes
6) Second frying - 190 C / 370 F - six minutes
7) Used vegetable oil specifically for deep frying.

I have two theories what could have went wrong:

a) I put all of them in the frying basket, I should have made them in smaller batches

b) I put the lid on when frying so the accumulated moisture probably made them soggier?

Tilapia: Chinese Water Influence?,33,j7m70z,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskCulinary/comments/j7m70z/tilapia_chinese_water_influence/,17,1602222203.0,"Hi r/AskCulinary!

I recently bought a 4lb bag of frozen tilapia and realized after it was sourced from China.  So, I did some digging on SeaFood watch and found their recommendations (sources at bottom of post), which basically concluded:  Any country, except China, will be at least ""okay"", but that the certification for most Chinese Tilapia (which represents >80% of the Tilapia that gets imported to the U.S. from all countries, btw) is marked ""okay"" (just barely, see ""benchmark"" reference below) by the Global Aquaculture Alliance.  


When I read through the 50+ pages of studies and more, I found nothing addressing the chemicals that were already in the water being an influence.  And to be fair, none of the other country sources/certs touched on it either - Seafood Watch seems to have dropped the ball on this, by instead addressing the chemicals output into the environment, while ignoring the input chemical factors (i.e. I'd like to know how safe I am eating the fish, not just how much it pollutes the water for wild fish - an important distinction).  


Scouring the web has left me at a loss, **which brings me to my questions:**  **Does anyone know of any resources covering water safety influence on fish?**  Notably, I am curious about Tilapia, but in general I'd love to know this answer!  This doesn't seem to be a straight-forward question, for two reasons:  
A.  Typically the chemicals we fear (i.e. mercury) are stored in bones (you won't eat that in tilapia) or fat (very little of that in tilapia, especially since it's culled young \[which also means less years of mercury accumulation\]).  So, mercury isn't a big concern (and I've read similar about most antibiotics, too), but **are there other chemicals of concern that live in the meat (protein) of the fish?**  If not, then the chemical levels of the water, from a human consumption health perspective, should be negligible.  
B.  The studies comparing water I have found are for seawater, but tilapia is a freshwater fish (i.e. grown in ponds).  


**Please Note:**  I've seen other redditors raise similar questions in past, but people often respond with unrelated stuff, so I'd please ask you try to keep responses on topic.  For instance, personal taste / cooking preference is cool, but there's other posts devoted to that already.  Discussions on omega six-to-3 ratio being very high is off-topic (and also kinda dumb imho, since the fish is culled young to have so little fat it should barely influence in an otherwise balanced diet).  Discussions about how it's more unhealthy than bacon (unfounded) and is a not real fish (i.e. you don't think tilapia exists in the wild?  Lol, okay).

I tried [this recipe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyuec0PPz68) the other day and found my cookies were the polar opposite of what I wanted; Very thin, crisp, and dry.

Now, my baking soda WAS expired, but I did test it by mixing with some acid and it bubbled up a good deal, which is to say I don't know if it was really the culprit. [This piece](https://www.seriouseats.com/2015/12/cookie-science-how-baking-soda-works.html) from Serious Eats about the science of baking soda also leads me to believe that baking soda makes cookies thinner and crispier, which, again, is \*NOT\* what I want. I've bought new baking soda and plan to try again, but I'm also wondering what other improvements I could make. 

The [Serious Eats cookie guide](https://sweets.seriouseats.com/2013/12/the-food-lab-the-best-chocolate-chip-cookies.html) leads me to believe that melted butter makes for density, but also leads me to believe it causes cookies to spread out and doesn't allow for body, which I guess make my goals somewhat conflicting. Virtually every recipe claiming chewy, dense cookies recommends melted butter, but I used it this last time with horrible results. Should I use cold butter and add another egg yolk to increase richness and density (hopefully) without killing body? Or keep the butter but add more flour for gluten development to give better body? I also mixed everything by hand to avoid whipping air in (can you tell I like dense baked goods?) but maybe this lack of gluten development was part of the problem?

Questions:

1. If caramelizing aromatics, tomato paste, stock ingredients like onions / carrots, etc. enhances flavour, why don't we do it for every single ingredient before tossing it into a braise or soup? 

2. Are there any reasons not to caramelize ingredients? For example, when making bolognese, why don't we cook the dried herbs in a bit of oil before added to the bolognese? What are common ingredients that don't need to be caramelized?

Decades.  I'm pretty proficient at it.  I seen some shit, to use a phrase that seems popular with the young people these days.  But this morning I had the strangest experience.

If I make a burger that's thicker than a smashburger, I temp the burger and pull it at 155F.  If it's a really, really thick burger like a half pound patty, then I may pull it at 160.  Regardless, it's cooked through after I let it rest.  

But today?  Today I temped a roughly 1/3 pound patty in the pan.  It read 157F in the thickest part of the patty.  Perfect, right?  Well, I don't know.  When I pulled the patty and let it rest, I toasted my bun and put on my toppings.  Then after about 5 minutes or so, I put my patty on my burger and sat down to eat. 

Imagine my surprise when I bit into this burger and it was a very dark shade of pink inside.  Like, if it were a steak, you'd have insisted it was medium rare judging by color.  It was that dark pink.  For the life of me I couldn't figure it out.  The Thermopen said it was almost 160 when I pulled it off the pan.  So, I took it back to the kitchen and temped it again where the dark pink meat was.  And now it said 156F.  

I **know** this meat is cooked.  It is hot to the touch and the probe clearly indicates it has been brought up to temp.  So, why is my ground beef still dark pink inside?  I went ahead an ate the burger.  It seemed to taste fine, but it was a bit anxiety-inducing not being sure why my burger patty didn't change color inside after being cooked.  

Here I am almost 12 hours later and not feeling sick at all, so that's a win.  And it did taste good.  Knowing for sure now that it doesn't mean I'll get sick I'll keep cooking with this ground beef and go ahead and eat it.  I would just love to know why this happened and what it means.

I have enough time to do anything to them and a home-sized vacuum sealer at my disposal.

I was thinking of the balance between the two main issues with preserving allium products:

1) you have to cut them up as conservatively as possible to prevent aromatic (culinarily, not chemically) compounds from breaking down

2) leeks often have dirt in between layers, so I have to halve and clean them up. Problem is, if I do that after thawing they will be mushy and hard to work with. 

So, what do you think? Should I bag and freeze them in whole segments that are as long as my vacuum sealer allows (longer chunks, fewer cuts), or cut each segment in half along its axis, clean it up, then freeze?

These noodles are paler, more tan/grey in color.

I have a couple of pie pumpkins lying around, and a ton of carrots that need to be used up. My plan is to roast them on the grill and then turn into puree.

I'd like to omit cinnamon from the cake due to a mild allergy, but I'm hard-pressed to think of a comparable substitute.

The marscapone filling is fairly straightforward. I'll soak some cardamom pods in heavy cream before making a stabilized filling. I'll also use it as a thin ""naked"" style frosting layer around the cake.

Pomegranate caramel sauce to top the cake and maybe drip a little. I'll make that with pomegranate molasses and it should bring a light tartness to the cake.

I've also thought about incorporating pistachios in a decorative fashion around the base of the cake.

So I originally wrote an extremely long post with the entire backstory of my life but that ended up at 2700 words (maybe I should try some therapy instead lol). I've tried now to shorten it alot, but I dont think I succeeded. So feel free to skip this post if you cannot be assed.

*Short backstory*

28y old male that after 8 years in a very toxic situation, my boss being a real psychopath (legit, he is today being investigated by the police for being reported by 3 people including me for emotional and physical abuse)  I moved across my entire country with my wife and started a new job.

But then I quit my ""new"" job right in february of this year cause the business I have been in for 8 years now gave me the heebie jeebies. 

Then Covid hit and it was impossible to get a new job. So I loafed around at home for 3-4 months, naturally cooking a whole bunch at home since that has been my biggest interest since I was like 15. 

*The Scenario:*

My entire life I've had a stupid belief (""If I start working as a cook I will probably lose all my passion and fun for cooking"") which I've now discovered is complete bullshit.

But I grew tired of that belief and finally said fuck it, I contacted the people who deal with cooking internships here and I got very lucky and got a long term internship at the best restaurant in my area.  
Reservations only, tasting menu, high end. Its also a very unique location and because of that the kitchen is a very small open solution and only has room for 3 ppl. This makes it so that the head chef mainly develops the menu, checks plate and otherwise entertains guests, while the rest of us (experienced cook and 2 interns) do EVERYTHING else. Doing everything is great for a new cook learning, instead of being a dishwasher for 6 months.

After a few weeks the issues start.   
I am in my own opinion an above average home cook as its been such a huge interest for me, by using books, videos and practice ive taught myself everything from professional knife skills, to baking to the science of food. 

But a high pace high end restaurant with very high standards makes me a bit nervous. 

So I obviously went into it with a very motivated but humble and careful mindset, being afraid of making too many mistakes and squandering my chance of staying there after new years (im trialing with pay untill january)

So for the first month I did things slowly and accurately. I doublechecked everything and did things way too meticulously and therefore was also much slower than necessary doing my tasks. 

And I properly noticed this a few weeks ago and I started the process of trying to better myself.

Trust myself alot more, do stuff that I know needs to be done, dont ask questions I know the answer to, speed everything up, ETC.

But I'm afraid it might be too late if I don't do something drastic.  
I feel that due to my first impression my two colleagues have a view of me that is not good for me at all. I think they feel I'm slow, dont know how to do stuff, need constant mentoring and cant be trusted with important things. Under is an example of this.

*The random example:*

So they end up viewing everything I do like that and after receiving a task its happened several times that the experienced cook has taken the task away from me in the middle of it because she thinks Im being too slow. 

Then I watch her finish the task and we were working at the same pace.   
But I was doing the stuff that you dont notice progress from right away (like peeling the onions first) or I had other tasks to do at the same time (emptying out the ice-cream maker or something) so I appear slower, and due to my first impression she thinks im being slow and takes it away from me.

*Conclusion and question:*

This was one hell of a ramble but I hope I get my point across.

I am worried that I will not keep my dream job if I dont do something drastic.

I have no clue how a normal kitchen operates, how the personalities usually are and how I should act in this situation.

"Does it really make sense to mix flour with softened butter, then knead it when making stollen?",2,j4zn7o,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskCulinary/comments/j4zn7o/does_it_really_make_sense_to_mix_flour_with/,1,1601849953.0,"All the recipes I see for stollen say to mix softened butter into the flour before doing any kneading. That sounded futile before I did it, because you'd expect the butter to inhibit gluten formation so much as to make kneading useless, especially since its usually a tonne of butter.
I've tried a couple of different recipes and the results were as expected, the mixture is more like cake than bread, It doesn't stretch at all. The finished product is ok but could be better.

So is my thinking right that kneading it, then mixing in the butter makes more sense? And also I was wondering, is stollen supposed to have a lot of gluten development, or is it actually supposed to be cakey (although if that's true then why do the recipes want me to knead it at all)?",askculinary

But how does one decide how much oil to use? Specifically, does more oil mean less fond stuck to the bottom of the pan but better, more consistent heat transfer into the full surface of the protein for ""fuller"" cooking and a greater surface area of browning? Is that a trade-off? If you finish your dish in the oven, does that affect how much oil is to be used?

Assume large stainless steel cookware is being used - large enough to easily fit at least 2 pieces of protein. Although if cast-iron (or non-stick carbon steel) is to be used differently, I'd love to learn more about that too.

Across all the cooking videos I've watched, I've seen:

Chicken: anywhere from a small amount of oil (a few tablespoons, lots of little dry spots in the pan) to a large amount of oil (like a small puddle, 1/8-1/4 an inch deep, enough to come up the bottom \~1 cm of the meat). From my personal experience, I've gotten more fond stuck to the bottom of the pan when using less oil. When I use more oil, I pour it off before deglazing, and a lot of the brown bits in the oil are poured off with it. I feel like I'm losing flavor when that happens.

Pork chops: a large amount of oil. Again, enough to come up the bottom \~1 cm of the meat. I may have seen a few videos with less oil, but can't remember.

Steak: like chicken, anywhere from little to no oil or a lot of oil. Some even dribble the oil on the steak itself before putting into the pan.

So, what's the technique and what are the trade-offs?",askculinary

I would like to make an Italian meringue that lasts long enough to use for service ideally for five consecutive days. I've made some progress and this is what I've learned so far.

* Use room temperature eggs.
* Use eggs that are as fresh as possible. Old eggs whip up more easily but form a less stable meringue.
* Use a tiny bit of tartaric acid or lemon juice on the bowl or while mixing the eggs.
* Use real eggs, not egg whites in a jug. Eggs in a jug have highly variable properties.
* Start beating the whites slowly and then gradually increase the speed to medium until soft peaks form. The slow speed in the beginning supposedly help to make air bubbles that are smaller and more stable, as far as I understand it.
* Add the syrup in a slow drizzle when the whites are at the soft peak stage.
* Don't overbeat the meringue.
* Absolutely no grease, whether in the bowl or on any tools. Any slightest bit of yolk in the whites you have to start over.

The parametric recipe I use is as follows:

* 100% egg whites
* 200% sugar
* 1% tartaric acid (I used 2% in my previous attempt but found that it affects the flavor quite a bit)
* Salt (optional, for flavor. Unsure if it has any effect on structure)
* 120C/248F

After the meringue has cooled down I put it all in piping bags and only open them as I need them for service.

The following are the signs of degradation:

* Texture will become noticeably less smooth and ""grainy"". In a bad meringue this degradation is noticeable over the course of a single evening.
* After a few days in the fridge the meringue may leak sugary syrup at which point it has to be discarded.
* After a few days, if the meringue is otherwise stable, chewy sugary flakes will form inside the meringue. At this point it will also have to be discarded.

&nbsp;

I have some ideas which might help make the meringue stay stable for longer:

* Never go faster than medium high while whipping.
* After all the syrup is added and the meringue has reached max volume/stiff peaks and it has to keep spinning for a few minutes to cool down, I will try and lower the speed to medium so as to not overbeat.
* Some sources have suggested freezing the meringue, I'm currently experimenting with this. I would freeze filled piping bags and defrost in the fridge over a few hours.
* I have access to various food stabilizers but I don't know of any that would make a difference? My only idea right now is to add egg white powder to the egg whites before beating.
* I've seen other recipes which use more sugar and cook to a lower temperature (115C/239F) which might behave differently and might be worth trying. However the formation of sugary flakes suggest to me that sugar wants to come out of the foam so adding more sugar might accelerate that process.
* Ambient humidity will have a detrimental effect but in a commercial kitchen this is mostly out of my control. Perhaps make the meringue early in the morning before we have a lot of stock pots boiling, dishwashers running, etc? Just throwing things at the wall here. Also this may be less of a factor for Italian meringue, not sure.
* I've seen the suggestion of adding gelatin to the sugar syrup before whipping. This could be worth exploring.

&nbsp;

I currently have a meringue that has retained reasonably good texture but has developed sugary, chewy flakes on day 5. I've not been able to find any information on why this problem occurs. I'm wondering if it could have something to do with specks of sugar syrup that don't get incorporated into the meringue while drizzling and end up on the side of the bowl? (Edit: [The author of this article has the same idea](https://foodcrumbles.com/a-blog-on-meringue-a-literature-study/#comment-6642). I will have to check next time if the sugar strands are there from the beginning or if they occur later as the meringue ages.)

&nbsp;

I'm looking for any suggestions on how I can change the recipe or procedure to make a meringue with better texture and that retains its structure for longer. If you work a lot with Italian meringue, do you have any tips of storage and how long do you expect your meringue to stay viable? Any advice would be much appreciated.

&nbsp;

Edit: [I found this discussion on Stackexchange interesting.](https://cooking.stackexchange.com/questions/35318/how-much-acid-to-use-for-stabilizing-meringue/35321#35321) It seems that the stability is greatly influenced by the pH. However, the pH of egg whites increases as the eggs age, so the only way to know the exact pH of your egg whites is to measure when you use them. This also suggests that the amount of tartaric acid I used (2% of the amount of egg whites, by weight) might have been excessive and had a detrimental effect on stability. I will try to see if I can find a better baseline to experiment with. The conclusion actually seems to be that lowering the pH will make the meringue whip up better, but be less stable. So the best method may actually be to omit the acid altogether for the most stable meringue.

&nbsp;

Edit: Most sources seem to suggest 1/8tsp tartaric acid per egg white (0.7g) which corresponds almost exactly to the 2g per 100g egg white that I used. I use a scale that measures tenths of a gram so the measurement was exact.",askculinary

How do I fix my creme brulee?,3,j3u0kc,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskCulinary/comments/j3u0kc/how_do_i_fix_my_creme_brulee/,15,1601672466.0,"So I'm developing a recipe for a pumpkin spice creme brulee but without eggs, because I don't eat eggs. I did some research and found out that the substitute is cornstarch. So I did all the same things... cream, milk, vanilla, sugar, pumpkin puree, spice mix, boil, add the cornstarch, let it thicken a little, and then put it in the oven with a hot water bath... I was told that I have to maintain a very low temperature for this so I did that and baked it for an hour at 120C. Nothing happened. It's still liquid and did not set.   
I figured I added too little cornstarch and I popped it back on the stove, added more and it got thicker. SO I put it back in the bowls and back in the oven for another hour and still nada... All it did was develop a thick skin on top. I'm frustrated and very close to giving up and eating paste... what went wrong? Is it not doable without eggs?

EDIT - I figured out a pretty amazing workaround.. in case anyone is interested..here goes - Yoghurt. 
Cook the milk, sugar and flavour mixture, turn the heat off, let the mixture get to a lukewarm temperature, whisk in a good amount of yoghurt, divide into serving bowls and bake at a very low temperature (100C or lower) for 35-40 minutes, and chill. Fermentation is amazing. I'm indian and we make plain yoghurt this way literally every day. Only that is fermented at room temperature and for longer so it takes on a sour tarty flavour.",askculinary
Does the brand/quality of cognac matter?,3,j3tpog,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskCulinary/comments/j3tpog/does_the_brandquality_of_cognac_matter/,27,1601671207.0,"Question:

I am in the market for some cognac (prolly gonna be Hennessey) to make coq au vin, does the quality of the cognac matter? Or would i get indistinguishable results if i used some cheaper brandy... For that matter, does the vodka in pasta alla vodka matter? what about the white wine in rissotto? Or the red wine in various marinades.

Motivation:

This question really extends to all alcohols used in cooking. I coked for my family one day and one of them brought a really good wine. We didn't finish it and it ended up in my fridge. One day in the middle of making chicken cacciatore i realized i hadn't bought wine (i use cheaper wine for coking), so i used the hella good wine in my fridge (which i typically reserve for drinking only) and the chicken cacciatore came out impossibly good. This made me wonder if and when the alcohol quality matters.

I love duck and I've made it several times. My main problem is the age-old question of how you get the skin properly crispy.. I've gathered as much as starting with a cold cast iron pan, but I can't seem to render enough fat before I feel it's time to finish it in the oven.

Do I need to finish the entire breast it in the pan to get the results I want? I've been served breasts that are perfectly red/pink throughout (as if they've been finished in an oven or done with a reverse sear sous vide) at restaurants that still have crisp skin.

I realize I can render fat for longer, but I'm afraid that spending too much time rendering will give me a breast that's more on the grey side halfway through.

I'm also going with a port wine sauce I figured I'd make from scratch this time with a basic recipe of shallots and port that get's strained and reduced. I've become partial to a tiny pinch of cayenne and a tsp og soy sauce myself. Any other great tweaks on this?

I am making bolognese for the second time very soon. The first recipe I used was [the Serious Eats version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wI9P8WFck0) and I enjoyed it. I followed it religiously except I accidentally forgot the onion and cream, but it still turned out amazing. I also used white wine instead of red. But I would like advice and suggestions on my planned revision based on the aforementioned recipe (written recipe is [here](https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2014/12/the-best-slow-cooked-bolognese-sauce-recipe.html)), as well as some questions answered:

\- Goat mince to replace the beef and the lamb mince

\- I want to add in courgettes and aubergine; approximately 110g or 1 cup of each respectively.  I may just add leeks only instead (same amount as both aforementioned veggies; 225g or 1 cup of it)

\- 1 bunch of parsley into the mirepoix since I don't taste cooked parsley anyway. I think it's there for just colour

\- Instead of sage for the herbs in the mirepoix, I want to add herbs de provence, and just use 1 bunch of parsley instead of half as the recipe calls for.

\- Smoked bacon instead of pancetta, and I will use the pork fat rendered (or more that I have in the fridge if needed) to saute the vegetables.

\- Double the amount of garlic cloves, and will be accompanied with a proportional amount of garlic powder.

\- no bay leaves (i don't taste them anyways)

\- pecorino instead of parmesan

\- going to add a moderately large sprig if fresh rosemary and put it in the bolognese as it cooks in the oven, and take it out when it's done

\- Radiatori pasta instead of pappardelle

\- heavy cream instead of milk

&#x200B;

The last ingredient is what I'm wary about. I'm not familiar with using heavy cream at all, but I have seen my sister use it, and I have seen her overcook it on some occasions and the cream starts to split, and I am wary of this happening so I'm not sure if I will be fine adding the cream in when I have to add the milk, or should I wait to add the cream in like in the video towards the end. I am also wary of adding 2 cups of cream, since I know cream has a very strong flavour and can easily mask other ingredients. Should I just stick to one cup, or will two be fine?

&#x200B;

Also again, any suggestions and advice with any of the ingredients is much appreciated. Thanks

edit: I should say authenticity isn't my goal here. I just called it bolognese because the recipe I'm citing did, even though in reality what the recipe I used and what I'm making are just bolognese-inspired meat sauces. ",askculinary

For those of you who have never had moose tracks, when frozen in ice cream it is brittle but soft like snapping a Hershey bar. When allowed to warm to room temperature it softens up to a thick syrup consistency and will mix/dissolve in the melted ice cream, but will clump together if left alone due to its density. What sets this stuff apart from other fudge is the texture, which is what I need help with. The mouthfeel is a fine grainyness that I assume comes from the cocoa and sugar structure.

Avoiding soggy skin when roasting a chicken on top of vegetables,3,j2b91q,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskCulinary/comments/j2b91q/avoiding_soggy_skin_when_roasting_a_chicken_on/,10,1601452693.0,"I absolutely love roasting vegetables underneath a chicken. All of the fat and juices drip down into the veggies and make them so more flavorful with no extra effort. But the main problem is the steam coming off the vegetables makes the skin on the bottom of the chicken soggy instead of brown and crispy like the top. 

The first time I tried doing this myself I just plopped the whole chicken on top of a roasting pan of veggies. The result was obviously that the entire underside of the chicken was soggy. I then tried using a wire rack over the roasting pan of veggies, hoping the small distance between the two would help, but it really didn’t do much. 

I’ve recently started butterflying chickenS over the summer for grilling. So I’m trying that this time so that the vast majority of the skin is facing upwards and should hopefully brown well. But there’s those pesky thighs and side bits of skin that I’m worried will still get steamed and not crispy. 

Is there anyway to avoid this? I don’t have a convection oven so that isn’t an option. I’ve thought of roasting the chicken directly on the oven rack well above the veggies below, but having to clean the rack plus the possibility of splatter across the oven just doesn’t seem worth the effort.

the dough i made yesterday spent about 8 hours in room temp (22C) and then another 11 hours in the refrigerator. took it out, rolled it into a ball and then spread it on a well-greased carbon steel pan. let it sit there for almost an hour, then fried it.  it came out pretty good. but next time i think i will portion it into smaller pieces for a more even browning, because the center cooked way faster than the edges. or cook it in the old cast iron... i have one but was just too lazy to use it lol. the texture was spot on, spongey like pizza hut pan pizza crust, and it crisped up very well.    
the taste was on the bland side even when fried in olive oil, but when i sprinkled a bit of salt over it, it was basically like eating pizza hut crust YUMMMM! i cut the crust up to small portions and i used buzzfeed's pizza dip on this - so salt sparingly. i'd post pics, except i forgot in all the excitement and gobbling hahaha. i would definitely make this again and would recommend it to anyone who likes pan pizza crusts!

Temperature of Pan for Cooking Steak,0,j1pqcx,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskCulinary/comments/j1pqcx/temperature_of_pan_for_cooking_steak/,7,1601372447.0,"Everyone always says that your cast iron pan should be the hottest in can be to get a good sear on a steak, so I tried following that direction. I preheated my 12' cast iron pan for an hour 500F then put it on the electric stove max heat for another 5 minutes. Then, when I tried putting grapeseed oil, an oil that has a high smoke point, it flared up and smoked like crazy. I have no way of getting fat in the pan because it all burns away, so I ended up putting a salt + pepper ribeye with no fat which skyrocketed the amount of smoke. One side was completely burned and not seared which I didn't even think was possible.

I had to completely turn off the heat, flip the steak over, and let it coast with the other side while butter basting. In the end, my steak was well done.

How can I make wasabi peas crisp but not hard?,4,j1o8pu,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskCulinary/comments/j1o8pu/how_can_i_make_wasabi_peas_crisp_but_not_hard/,5,1601366999.0,"So I've been trying to make wasabi peas (actually with much less of that coating, so more like [these](https://nuts.com/snacks/asian/fried-green-peas.html) in texture) but can't get them to be both crisp AND not-rock-hard.

I soaked dry peas and boiled them until they were soft enough to chew, then tossed them in oil, spices and flour and tried roasting or frying them. In either case, if the water evaporated enough then they seemed to return to their original rock-hard state.

I'd like to lighten up the batter to get it closer to a coffee cake so I can potentially add a strusel topping for a more interesting texture and presentation, but I'm not even sure where to start. My initial thoughts are to change the fat from vegetable oil to butter, and sub out half of the brown sugar for white sugar; but I'm not sure if that's even a good jumping off point for my goal.

UPDATE: I couldn’t hold back.. I made Mac and cheese. It turned out amazing and the best I have ever had. Thank you for your help, strangers (now friends) of Reddit. 
What I did: Let the butter cook down and used a lower heat than I normally do. Once it was enough I added the flour and mixed it very well with a whisk. I added room temp milk slowly and whisked it to hell. Then once I waited a bit, I took it off of the heat and slowly added some cheese slices and....SELF shredded cheese (mozz and cheddar)!! Oh also some cheese whiz which I saw recommended. I let it melt instead of cooking it! Then I whisked and combined it well and there was not a single ounce of graininess: perfection.

I did a 2.2% salt equilibrium brine and ~130 ppm nitrate for 9 days. It was 3kg eye of round/noix 12cm wide.

Reheating Meat without Damage (Specifically Rabbit) - Possible?,3,j0zasv,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskCulinary/comments/j0zasv/reheating_meat_without_damage_specifically_rabbit/,3,1601271059.0,"I'm planning a gourmet dinner for some friends, and I'm looking at this recipe for an appetizer: [https://www.meatpoultryon.ca/recipes/rabbit-and-brie-tartine/](https://www.meatpoultryon.ca/recipes/rabbit-and-brie-tartine/)  


It looks tasty and interesting, but I'm also trying to minimize the amount of ""real cooking"" I have to do in the middle of the event.  


I was thinking I could cook the rabbit earlier in the day or the day before, put it in a vacuum sealed bag, and then slowly reheat it to just above room temperature using a sous vide water bath.  I figure that's something that can just sit in the corner on the counter, doesn't require much attention, and is hard to screw up.  


The only question is would any part of that affect the quality of the meat?

Creme Brulee: separation of custard and fat,5,j0yucp,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskCulinary/comments/j0yucp/creme_brulee_separation_of_custard_and_fat/,3,1601269436.0,"Creme Brulee has a distinct top layer that looks like it has much higher fat content than the custard below. I am trying this as a new recipe as I am looking for creme brulee with a creamier consistency rather than jelly like. 

**Recipe**

I mostly followed one from The Science of Good Cooking with few slight modifications. Original (split in half):

1. 2 cups of heavy cream (470 ml)
2. 2.3 ounces of sugar (65g)
3. 6 yolks

Mine:

1. 450ml of heavy cream + 50ml of whole milk (so just bit more than 2 cups with a slightly lower fat content - I simply run out of cream)
2. 65g of sugar (the same)
3. 6 yolks (again, the same)

I boiled the cream + milk + sugar + vanilla. Let it cool to 80C (176F), mixed with yolks in small batches. I baked in in the over + water bath at 135C (275F, recommended 300F but I felt like in previous experiments I was getting it overcooked in shallow ramekins). 

I baked it for about 23 minutes, till the center reached 77-79C (170F-174F). Initially everything looked fine, but after cooling down I see this layer of fat at the top.

**(Potential) Next Steps**

1. I am considering adding another yolk or two to make the emulsion better. 
2. Maybe lowering fat content, but I am worried that this will destroy the texture.

Question About Pork Belly Skin,95,j09imn,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskCulinary/comments/j09imn/question_about_pork_belly_skin/,31,1601168012.0,"For reference, I followed the temps/times in this recipe: https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2011/12/all-belly-porchetta-recipe-italian-roast-pork.html.

My question is - how exactly do I get it crispy rather than chewy? The meat turns out *fantastic*, but the skin is always a disappointment.

Regardless, most recipes say to leave it uncovered in the fridge overnight to dehydrate it (unfortunately, I missed the part in the recipe that asked to dry brine it covered), and despite doing that for my first porchetta, the skin didn't crisp up.

After some googling, I found a [comment by Kenji](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskCulinary/comments/19nrw2/pork_belly_skin_rock_hard_everytime/) stating that it's caused by the skin dehyrating before the collagen can convert to gelatin. With that in mind, I assumed the issue with my first attempt lay with the fact that the skin basically dehydrated because I didn't cover it.

Anyway, I attempted round 2 with that piece of information in mind. I kept my pork belly covered tightly in wrap/foil overnight, reduced my cooking temp to 250F and kept it wrapped in foil (the idea was for whatever steam produced to keep things moist) for the first hour. I thought I had done everything right this time, but the skin turned out just as chewy.

This is where I'm literally stumped and was wondering if anyone (hi, /u/J_Kenji_Lopez-Alt/, sorry if this is not allowed but would appreciate any thoughts if you have time!) could help? Some things I noted from my second attempt:

1) Despite being wrapped in foil for the first hour, the surface didn't feel that hot when I removed the foil. 

- Should I just tend the surface rather than wrapping it?
- Or, should I keep it wrapped longer?

2) Alternatively, could it just be the pork I got? Both attempts were from a relatively reputable butchery, but is it possible the pork belly skin had already dehydrated when I purchased it? Does that happen?

3) For the other option, could I just sous vide it and let it slowly come to serving temp in an oven before crisping up the skin in a 500F oven? Would the moist environment for the sous vide cook expedite the collagen -> gelatin conversion?

4) Recipes for sio bak (Chinese roast pork) asks for holes to be pricked in the meat to help the fat render or even have the skin scored. Is that something worth doing?

5) Finally, this is just for my own curiosity, but why do so many roast pork belly recipes call for the skin to be dehydrated in the fridge overnight? Wouldn't that just result in chewy skin if there's not enough moisture for the collagen -> gelatin conversion?

Anyway, sorry for the long wall of text, but given the amount of time investment making it, I'd like to start round 3 with as much information possible to succeed. Thanks!",askculinary

Beurre monté science,38,izqc6h,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskCulinary/comments/izqc6h/beurre_monté_science/,29,1601091417.0,"I am interested in the science of cooking and do not fully understand why you need a tablespoon of water to emulsify the butterfat. Butter already contains water?

\- Butter consists of water, butterfat and milksolids  
\- Butter is a water-in-oil emulsion  
\- Beurre monté is a reversed emulsion; oil-in-water  
\- Melted butter is a broken emulsion; the water, butterfat and milksolids separated  
Why do you need the extra water? Can't one heat butter to 100 degrees, so it fully separates, and then whisk it to make it beurre monté? Or is the structure somehow changed permanently if you do? And is melted butter more greasy than beurre monté because it is thinned with water, of because the emulsion is reversed (so the fat coats the tongue differently for example)?

I bought 6 lbs of onions and 20 lbs of chicken. I have already bake the chicken and separated the meat from the bones/joints. I have 4 quarts of meat and about the same in bones, skin, joints and about 1.5 quarts of strained fat/juices. I'm planning on roasting the onions along with some garlic and 1 lb baby carrots. I will be using a 21 1/2 quart weighted gauge pressure canner to make approximately 14 quarts of broth and can it in 2 batches.

**First question, to you think 14 quarts of broth to 20lbs meat/bones is a good ratio? Will it be too watery or too concentrated?**

I want to make the most flavorful yet cheap chicken broth I can. With pressure canning it's generally not a good idea to add a lot of herbs and spices to the foods because the flavor changes sometimes significantly. Sage for example tastes bitter when pressure canned. Black pepper and rosemary taste fine but become much more noticeable. Because of that I want to maximize the flavor of the meat and bones. 

My idea was to rebake the meat, past the point of where it would be appetizing to eat. We're talking golden brown, dried jerky like texture, not burnt or anything, just very, very caramelized. I figure this would give a much more robust chicken flavor. I might bake the bones longer as well, I don't know if that will add to the flavor or not. 

**Second question, does roasting bones increase flavor or is that a waste of time/energy?**

I'm not planning on eating any of the meat, I just want the broth. 

**Third question, is there any down side to caramelizing the chicken meat to the point where it's dried and chewy? Will doing this improve the flavor of the broth?**",askculinary

Do these proteins have similar properties to milk proteins in that they can theoretically make frozen desserts less icy or better emulsify fats in water as evaporated milk does for mac and cheese?

When to dock my piecrust (par / blind baking)?,5,iyrmqp,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskCulinary/comments/iyrmqp/when_to_dock_my_piecrust_par_blind_baking/,3,1600955932.0,"Hi,

So I have my all-butter piecrust ready to bake in a deep stoneware pie plate. It's cold (was in freezer for a few min prior). The oven is pre-heated at 425 (higher than my later baking temp). I have my pie weights and parchment. I am making a quiche.

Do I:

A:
- liberally dock the cold pie crust, put the parchment and pie weights on, then proceed to bake for 15 (?) min, remove weights, resume baking for another 5-7 min or so (or until golden brown and crisp for full blindbake), then fill and bake at a lower temp (350) for however long until golden brown

Or

B:
- put the parchment and pie weights on, bake for 15 (?) minutes, remove weights, dock the pie crust all over at this point, bake for 5-7 min or so (or until golden brown), then fill and bake at lower temp for however long until golden brown

Just asking because I tried to do B but my crust actually bubbled up quite large in the center (one huge steam bump) despite  my docking after removing the weights. I felt it was hard to dock it and poke holes properly since the crust was warmed up and kinda soft texture wise with melted butter everywhere. However, I was just following what most blind-baking guides seem to suggest.

I ended up poking holes through the bubble and deflating it, then filled and baked and it still turned out ok, though I felt the bottom could've been crisper / more cooked through. The sides and fluting of the pie did stay nice and put (no sliding), it was just the bottom that puffed up. Been reheating in toaster oven and the add'l baking time seems to help crisp the bottom up, but I'd still like to know how to prevent the bubbling.

Did I not dock enough? Was the pie not cooked enough before I removed the weights (it looked solid but wasn't anywhere near golden yet)? Could the thickness of the dough when rolled affect it? Does the order of when to dock really even matter? Am I missing something else entirely?

Any insight on how to create perfectly flaky golden crust welcome. Thanks!",askculinary

Since I haven't used a mortar & pestle in any cooking capacity so I don't know if this is just a gimmick to trick cooking noobs like me since we don't know any better or if it might actually make it more useful for a variety of things.

I used a spatula after serving to try to detach the leftover bits in the pan so they wouldn’t stick, and it seemed to work. I let the pan cool while eating and then washed it out with hot water (steaming) and a paper towel before drying it with a dish towel.

Do different cuts of beef sear differently?,20,iydaq3,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskCulinary/comments/iydaq3/do_different_cuts_of_beef_sear_differently/,9,1600906838.0,"Hey everyone! I'm hoping ya'll can help me solve a mystery here.

Lately, my go-to method for cooking steaks is
 
1. Sous vide @120

2. Pat dry and season

3. Place on pellet grill at 500-550

This has turned out some incredible meat. My picanha and trip tip steaks have come out with this amazing black/dark brown crust while being perfectly medium rare and juicy on the inside...

And then I bought some rib eye steaks. I was so excited to have what I would consider to be the perfect steak....

But oh how disappointed was it. It seems no matter what, I simply cannot get that same kind of sear on my rib eyes.

Now, there are some additional factors that very well may be the cause

1. I live in Canada so the temperature could be 5-15 degrees colder outside right now than it was a month or two ago. It would make sense that I am losing a ton of hot air at the grates when I open the lid and put the steak on.

2. It is possible I am cooking them for slightly less time. I typically do it by feel and I really don't think I am doing this but it is a possibility.

3. I am using different pellets right now but I don't think that would have much of an impact.

4. I am using a different seasoning blend, but again, I don't really see how that would change things

Then, separately, mix:  

* 500g white beard flour (13% protein)
* 20g Honey
*  5g Salt
* 30g Melted Butter
* Then mixed in the yeast water.
* I kneaded it by hand for about 6-7 minutes and then let it rise for 1 hour (until 2x in size).
* Then I knocked it back and shaped it into the loaves and let proof for 20min.
* To bake, I put it in a 400F oven with a skillet of boiling water at the rack below.
* At 8 minutes I removed the water and continued for 15min more.

Is there a way around this result? The obvious thing that comes to mind is covering the pan with foil, but I'm reasonably certain that would trap in moisture and keep my edges from getting that perfect, blackened, crispy outcome that makes Detroit-style pizza so great. I also fear it would keep my pepperoni from crisping up and curling into little cups of salty, greasy goodness. So I'd like to avoid covering the pan if at all possible.

The other obvious solution would be to buck tradition and put the sauce under the cheese, but I worry this would affect the rise/texture of the dough and how the cheese melts/caramelizes, especially since it is a much thicker sauce that gets used in Detroit-style pizza. But that is all totally speculation, so perhaps I'm very wrong about this?

Trying to troubleshoot my Steak Cooks (Tried sous vide & reverse sear),2,ixxprj,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskCulinary/comments/ixxprj/trying_to_troubleshoot_my_steak_cooks_tried_sous/,15,1600842123.0,"Hi everyone, 

I'm trying to get to the bottom of an issue I keep having when cooking steaks. I can't quite seem to get it to the level that I want it. I'm using very good meat (Creekestone Farms dry aged prime ribeyes and ny strips (both about 1-1.25 in thick). 

I recently had my parents and some others over so I made 5 steaks. 2 of the rib eyes and 3 strips. I decided to try and do a few different methods. Steaks were brought up to room temp before prep. 

Method 1:

Sous Vide: I put a few sprigs of thyme, some sliced garlic and salt and pepper, vaccum sealed and put in at 131 for 1.5 hours. Once finished, i remove, pat dry and let cool a bit at room temp. 

Method 2: 

Reverse sear: I oil and then salt and pepper the other 3 steaks and throw em in the smoker (Traeger) at 185 until I get to about 115-120 internal. 

I suspect my chase for the perfect sear is the cause of my issues but, I know most people are searing for 30secs-2 min total but i never seem to be able to get that dark crust that I'm looking for in that amount of time.  I've tried searing on everything from cast iron, to all clad fry pan to steel camp chef griddle which i put on top of my grill. I've used everything from clarified butter, avacado oil, peanut oil and a combo of some of them. I've even tried brushing with corn syrup as I read fructose can increase the Mailliard reactions

This past time, i was using the camp chef steel griddle (linked here: [https://tinyurl.com/y69cf8ly](https://tinyurl.com/y69cf8ly)) and used veg oil initially and a little butter towards the end. The sous vide steaks had cooled to about 108 by the time I put them on for sear (more than i intended) and maybe 120 for the reverse sear steaks. The reverse sear prob took 3-4 min on the sear and closer to 5-6 min on the sous vide. I am checking the internal temp on all the steaks intermittently to make sure they aren't over cooking and I'm pulling in the mid 130s for a med rare. 

I end up slicing them in order to serve( since it's 5 steaks for 8 people) after a brief rest period (about 5 min).

They always seem to dry out very quickly, get cold very quickly and they had this mealy texture that I  was just so disappointed in. I got a fajita cast iron serving tray which i will warm in the oven to attempt to combat the quick cooling down but overall, nothing seemed to work. I know places like Lugars are getting superior meat and are getting their sears in Salamander broilers but I feel like I should be able to get a lot closer than I am currently getting. 

Was hoping to get some thoughts/tips/suggestions on the process as this is something Ive been chasing for a while now and still dont have much to show for it.

How do restaurants handle excessively starchy water?,384,ixyljn,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskCulinary/comments/ixyljn/how_do_restaurants_handle_excessively_starchy/,75,1600845259.0,"A bit of a weird question, sorry.
I was making jjajangmyeong for 4 people, and 4 portions of noodles in a 6 qt pot of water turned the water into a thick, viscous starch water mixture. I noticed that this tends to only happen with Asian noodles, and not dried pasta. That pot is the biggest one I have, so I run into this issue often when making Asian noodles. 

I tried googling how do restaurants deal with starchy water, but obviously I only got hits for ""save your pasta water to make restaurant quality pasta!""

I also looked at webrestaurantstore for noodle boilers to see if that would clarify anything, but not really. Those noodle boilers hold a lot more water, but a restaurant also goes through a lot more portions than the 4 I made. And I can't imagine they dump, refill, reboil water. Seems way too inefficient. I know a lot of restaurants parboil then portion pasta, but I'd imagine that they would still run into overly starchy water.

So yea, if anyone can shine some light on this matter, I'd greatly appreciate it.

edit:
Got through all the replies. Thank you all so much, I had no idea there was a steady supply of fresh water on some of those pasta cookers, and the other setups make sense too!",askculinary
Can I make chashu pork with thickly sliced pork belly?,1,ixy5r9,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskCulinary/comments/ixy5r9/can_i_make_chashu_pork_with_thickly_sliced_pork/,2,1600843709.0,"Hi, making ramen this week. I could only find pork belly sliced into these long strips about 1 inch thick (similar to super thick cut bacon or a kbbq pork belly cut) at the store.

All the recipes I’ve seen use rolled or block form pork belly, so I’m not sure if I need to make any adjustments to the recipe since my pork is less thick. Help appreciated! Thanks.",askculinary

Is there a difference between whole milk and whole cream milk?,1,ixxqaw,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskCulinary/comments/ixxqaw/is_there_a_difference_between_whole_milk_and/,1,1600842176.0,"I was looking at whole milk at the store the other day and saw some in glass bottles. The cap said whole cream milk and when I shook the bottle it was definately thick and not loose like regular milk. So I'm curious if there's a real difference/ can whole cream milk be used for let's say mac and cheese or can it be used in baking that requires whole milk?

Marinated chicken for 24+ hours (with lemon),3,ixvlp8,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskCulinary/comments/ixvlp8/marinated_chicken_for_24_hours_with_lemon/,5,1600835353.0,"Hello! I made a pretty typical marinade for some chicken breast (olive oil, soy sauce, brown sugar, garlic, Worcestershire,  etc). The marinade also had lemon juice + lemon zest. I started marinating around 4 pm yesterday thinking that I would make it for dinner but something else came up. Ive been reading on this subreddit that leaving chicken in a marinade with acid for too long will make the chicken mushy and unappealing. Should I cook it and see what happens or just toss it?

Also if anyone has any fun ideas for different marinades, would love to hear them!!",askculinary

Question about blanching meat for stews / soups,2,ixtq0a,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskCulinary/comments/ixtq0a/question_about_blanching_meat_for_stews_soups/,15,1600829661.0,"Before adding meat to a soup / stew, I was taught to always blanche the meat first. 

This is done by placing the meat in a pot of cold water, adding ginger and a little chinese wine, then heating aggressively until the water has boiled. The water is discarded if dirty, and the meat can be rinsed again in cold water, if dirty. 

Questions :

How long should the water be boiling for? 

Can I start with a piece of frozen meat, or do I need to thaw it out first

Does the ginger and chinese wine make a big difference?",askculinary
